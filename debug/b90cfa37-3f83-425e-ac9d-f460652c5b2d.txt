Possible solutions:
- Ensure optional dependencies can be installed:
    npm install --include=optional sharp
- Ensure your package manager supports multi-platform installation:
    See https://sharp.pixelplumbing.com/install#cross-platform
- Add platform-specific dependencies:
    npm install --os=linux --cpu=x64 sharp
- Consult the installation documentation:
