{"display":"If you're asking this I assume you already know what a VLAN actually is but I'll quickly try and put it in simple terms - A VLAN is a virtual-LAN (Local Area Network). It's used as a way of segregating one physical network in to multiple logically-isolated networks. A classic example is on a network switch. On a default configuration where all ports are on the default VLAN, all the devices connected to the switch can see each other and communicate. If you then assign one of the switch ports to a different VLAN than the default, that port will no longer be able to communicate with the other devices on the switch as it's now essentially in a different network. This can be useful for various security or admin reasons. A lot of the time you don't want your VLANs just to be limited to one switch though. You might want VLANs that span across your whole network. That's where VLAN tagging comes in. Using VLAN tagging you can essentially stamp the VLAN number on to a network packet before it is sent out of the switch. This means that when it arrives at its destination the receiving device knows which VLAN the packet belongs to. The upside of tagging is it means you can jumble up all the data being sent from every VLAN on a switch and send it all together through one port, known as a \"trunk\" port and when it gets to its destination, the device can read the VLAN tag and easily know where the packet needs to be sent.

Start here for 10x faster navigation!\nResource Links: Search results now include MCP resource links for direct note access\nContext Snippets in Search Results: Search results now include surrounding lines for better context understanding\nMatch Highlighting: Search terms are highlighted with bold markers in results\nImproved Search Result Structure: Results are now grouped by file with match counts and snippets\nInstallation\nnpm install\nUsage\nTesting with MCP Inspector\n# Replace /home/decoder/dev/obsidian/decoder with your vault path\nnpx @modelcontextprotocol/inspector node src/index.js /home/decoder/dev/obsidian/decoder\nThe inspector will open at http://localhost:5173\n\nRunning Tests\n# Run all tests\nnpm test\n\n# Run tests in watch mode\nnpm run test:watch\n\n# Run tests with coverage report\nnpm run test:coverage\n\n# Run tests with coverage and check thresholds\nnpm run coverage\n\n# Run mutation testing (all files)\nnpm run test:mutation\n\n# Run mutation testing (pagination code only -

{"display":"Todoist AI and MCP SDK\nLibrary for connecting AI agents to Todoist. Includes tools that can be integrated into LLMs, enabling them to access and modify a Todoist account on the user's behalf.\n\nThese tools can be used both through an MCP server, or imported directly in other projects to integrate them to your own AI conversational interfaces.\n\nUsing tools\n1. Add this repository as a dependency\nnpm install @doist/todoist-ai\n\n2. Import the tools and plug them to an AI\nHere's an example using Vercel's AI SDK.\n\nimport { findTasksByDate, addTasks } from \"@doist/todoist-ai\";\nimport { TodoistApi } from \"@doist/todoist-api-typescript\";\nimport { streamText } from \"ai\";\n\n// Create Todoist API client\nconst client = new TodoistApi(process.env.TODOIST_API_KEY);\n\n// Helper to wrap tools with the client\nfunction wrapTool(tool, todoistClient) {\n    return {\n        ...tool,\n        execute(args) {\n            return tool.execute(args, todoistClient);\n        },\n    };\n}\n\nconst result = streamText({\n    model: yourModel,\n    system: \"You are a helpful Todoist assistant\",\n    tools: {\n        findTasksByDate: wrapTool(findTasksByDate, client),\n        addTasks: wrapTool(addTasks, client),\n    },\n});\n\nUsing as an MCP server\nQuick Start\nYou can run the MCP server directly with npx:\n\nnpx @doist/todoist-ai\n\nSetup Guide\nThe Todoist AI MCP server is available as a streamable HTTP service for easy integration with various AI clients:\n\nPrimary URL (Streamable HTTP): https://ai.todoist.net/mcp\n\nClaude Desktop\nOpen Settings → Connectors → Add custom connector\nEnter https://ai.todoist.net/mcp and complete OAuth authentication\nCursor\nCreate a configuration file:\n\nGlobal: ~/.cursor/mcp.json\nProject-specific: .cursor/mcp.json\n{\n  \"mcpServers\": {\n    \"todoist\": {\n      \"command\": \"npx\",\n      \"args\": [\"-y\", \"mcp-remote\", \"https://ai.todoist.net/mcp\"]\n    }\n  }\n}\n\nThen enable the server in Cursor settings if prompted.\n\nClaude Code (CLI)\nFirstly configure Claude so it has a new MCP available using this command:\n\nclaude mcp add --transport http todoist https://ai.todoist.net/mcp\n\nThen launch claude, execute /mcp, then select the todoist MCP server.\n\nThis will take you through a wizard to authenticate using your browser with Todoist. Once complete you will be able to use todoist in claude.\n\nVisual Studio Code\nOpen Command Palette → MCP: Add Server\nSelect HTTP transport and use:\n{\n  \"servers\": {\n    \"todoist\": {\n      \"type\": \"http\",\n      \"url\": \"https://ai.todoist.net/mcp\"\n    }\n  }\n}\n\nOther MCP Clients\nnpx -y mcp-remote https://ai.todoist.net/mcp\n\nFor more details on setting up and using the MCP server, including creating custom servers, see docs/mcp-server.md.\n\nFeatures\nA key feature of this project is that tools can be reused, and are not written specifically for use in an MCP server. They can be hooked up as tools to other conversational AI interfaces (e.g. Vercel's AI SDK).\n\nThis project is in its early stages. Expect more and/or better tools soon.\n\nNevertheless, our goal is to provide a small set of tools that enable complete workflows, rather than just atomic actions, striking a balance between flexibility and efficiency for LLMs.\n\nFor our design philosophy, guidelines, and development patterns, see docs/tool-design.md.\n\nAvailable Tools\nFor a complete list of available tools, see the src/tools directory.\n\nOpenAI MCP Compatibility\nThis server includes search and fetch tools that follow the OpenAI MCP specification, enabling seamless integration with OpenAI's MCP protocol. These tools return JSON-encoded results optimized for OpenAI's requirements while maintaining compatibility with the broader MCP ecosystem.\n\nDependencies\nMCP server using the official @modelcontextprotocol/sdk\nTodoist Typescript API client @doist/todoist-api-typescript\nMCP Server Setup\nSee docs/mcp-server.md for full instructions on setting up the MCP server.\n\nLocal Development Setup\nSee docs/dev-setup.md for full instructions on setting up this repository locally for development and contributing.\n\nQuick Start\nAfter cloning and setting up the repository:\n\nnpm start - Build and run the MCP inspector for testing\nnpm run dev - Development mode with auto-rebuild and restart\nReleasing\nThis project uses release-please to automate version management and package publishing.\n\nHow it works\nMake your changes using Conventional Commits:\n\nfeat: for new features (minor version bump)\nfix: for bug fixes (patch version bump)\nfeat!: or fix!: for breaking changes (major version bump)\ndocs: for documentation changes\nchore: for maintenance tasks\nci: for CI changes\nWhen commits are pushed to main:\n\nRelease-please automatically creates/updates a release PR\nThe PR includes version bump and changelog updates\nReview the PR and merge when ready\nAfter merging the release PR:\n\nA new GitHub release is automatically created\nA new tag is created\nThe publish workflow is triggered\nThe package is published to npm How would I configure this todoist vscode mcp for my claude code to use?","pastedContents":{},"timestamp":1764201495267,"project":"/home/stanner","sessionId":"46ef9518-c024-4fa4-8afe-71f74c6a770a"}

Then it will always call the tool.\n\nThe use prompts like this:\n\nGet the contents of the last architecture call note and summarize them\nSearch for all files where Azure CosmosDb is mentioned and quickly explain to me the context in which it is mentioned\nSummarize the last meeting notes and put them into a new note 'summary meeting.md'. Add an introduction so that I can send it via email.\nConfiguration\nObsidian REST API Key\nThere are two ways to configure the environment with the Obsidian REST API Key.\n\nAdd to server config (preferred)\n{\n  \"mcp-obsidian\": {\n    \"command\": \"uvx\",\n    \"args\": [\n      \"mcp-obsidian\"\n    ],\n    \"env\": {\n      \"OBSIDIAN_API_KEY\": \"<your_api_key_here>\",\n      \"OBSIDIAN_HOST\": \"<your_obsidian_host>\",\n      \"OBSIDIAN_PORT\": \"<your_obsidian_port>\"\n    }\n  }\n}\nSometimes Claude has issues detecting the location of uv / uvx. You can use which uvx to find and paste the full path in above config in such cases.\n\nCreate a .env file in the working directory with the following required variables:\nOBSIDIAN_API_KEY=your_api_key_here\nOBSIDIAN_HOST=your_obsidian_host\nOBSIDIAN_PORT=your_obsidian_port\nNote:\n\nYou can find the API key in the Obsidian plugin config\nDefault port is 27124 if not specified\nDefault host is 127.0.0.1 if not specified\nQuickstart\nInstall\nObsidian REST API\nYou need the Obsidian REST API community plugin running: https://github.com/coddingtonbear/obsidian-local-rest-api\n\nInstall and enable it in the settings and copy the api key.\n\nClaude Desktop\nOn MacOS: ~/Library/Application\\ Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json\n\nOn Windows: %APPDATA%/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json\n\nDevelopment/Unpublished Servers Configuration\nPublished Servers Configuration\nDevelopment\nBuilding\nTo prepare the package for distribution:\n\nSync dependencies and update lockfile:\nuv sync\nDebugging\nSince MCP servers run over stdio, debugging can be challenging. For the best debugging experience, we strongly recommend using the MCP Inspector.\n\nYou can launch the MCP Inspector via npm with this command:\n\nnpx @modelcontextprotocol/inspector uv --directory /path/to/mcp-obsidian run mcp-obsidian\nUpon launching, the Inspector will display a URL that you can access in your browser to begin debugging.\n\nYou can also watch the server logs with this command:\n\ntail -n 20 -f ~/Library/Logs/Claude/mcp-server-mcp-obsidian.log\nAbout\nMCP server that interacts with Obsidian via the Obsidian rest API community plugin\n\nResources\n Readme\nLicense\n MIT license\n Activity\nStars\n 2.5k stars\nWatchers\n 16 watching\nForks\n 307 forks\nReport repository\nReleases\nNo releases published\nPackages\nNo packages published\nContributors\n16\n@MarkusPfundstein\n@jevy\n@7shi\n@shipurjan\n@tibbon\n@txbm\n@TheEpTic\n@Csaba8472\n@felipemeres\n@TheConnMan\n@sizhky\n@thomato\n@sfedyakov\n@eltociear\n+ 2 contributors\nLanguages\nPython\n100.0%\nFooter\n© 2025 GitHub, Inc.\nFooter navigation\nTerms\nPrivacy\nSecurity\nStatus\nCommunity\nDocs\nContact\nManage cookies\nDo not share my personal information\n Show me how to do this now","pastedContents":{},"timestamp":1764204806521,"project":"/home/stanner","sessionId":"f23a251d-353a-40fd-8fe5-a288b1198604"}
