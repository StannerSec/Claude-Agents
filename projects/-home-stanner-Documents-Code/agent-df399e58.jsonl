Do NOT use sudo with this command unless absolutely necessary, as it can cause permission issues.\n\n**Native Binary Installation:**\nFor macOS, Linux, and WSL, you can install the stable version with: curl -fsSL https://claude.ai/install.sh | bash. Native installations are ideal for environments where Node.js is unavailable or for those wanting faster startup times and easier updates.\n\n## System Requirements\n\nClaude Code supports macOS 10.15+, Ubuntu 20.04+/Debian 10+, or Windows 10+ (with WSL 1, WSL 2, or Git for Windows). Install Node.js 18+—the primary prerequisite for all npm-based installations.\n\n## Authentication & Setup\n\nConnect through the Claude Console and complete the OAuth process, which requires active billing at console.anthropic.com.

Key Capabilities and Available Tools\n\n#### Core Capabilities\n- **Code Analysis**: Answer questions about code architecture and implementation\n- **Code Generation**: Write new features, fixes, and refactoring\n- **PR Management**: Analyze changes and suggest improvements\n- **CLI Tool Integration**: Use Git, npm, and other command-line tools\n- **API Access**: Work with GitHub APIs and file operations\n\n#### Tools and Integration\n- **MCP Servers**: Connect to hundreds of external tools via Model Context Protocol\n- **Slash Commands**: Type `/` to see all available commands, including:\n  - `/hooks` - Configure automation hooks\n  - `/help` - Display help information\n  - `/clear` - Clear conversation history\n  - Custom commands from installed plugins\n- **Plugin System**: Install additional capabilities including slash commands, subagents, MCP servers, and hooks\n\n#### What Claude Code Cannot Do\n- Cannot submit formal GitHub PR reviews or approvals (for security reasons)\n- Cannot perform branch operations like merging or rebasing\n- Cannot handle complex/unconventional architectures reliably (event-driven systems, microservices with complex patterns)\n- May struggle with highly customized or legacy systems using non-standard patterns\n- Limited on cutting-edge frameworks not well-represented in training data\n\n---\n\n### 5. Configuration: Hooks, Settings, and Customization\n\n#### Configuration File Hierarchy\n\nClaude Code uses a three-level configuration system:\n\n**User Settings** (`~/.claude/settings.json`)\n- Applies to all projects\n- Global preferences and defaults\n\n**Project Settings** (`.claude/settings.json`)\n- Project-specific configuration\n- Checked into Git (shared with team)\n- Template file for team standards\n\n**Local Project Settings** (`.claude/settings.local.json`)\n- Personal preferences for a project\n- Ignored by Git (never committed)\n- Overrides both user and project settings\n\n#### Hook Configuration\n\nHooks are user-defined shell commands that execute at various lifecycle points in Claude Code:\n\n**Hook Events:**\n- **PreToolUse**: Runs before Claude executes a tool (can block execution)\n- **PostToolUse**: Runs after tool completion\n- **PermissionRequest**: Runs when a permission dialog is shown\n- **Notification**: When Claude sends notifications\n- **SessionEnd**: When Claude Code session ends\n\n**Configuration Method:**\n```bash\n/hooks\n```\nUse the interactive `/hooks` command in Claude Code to configure hooks through a menu interface (easier than editing JSON directly).\n\n#### Example Settings Structure\n```json\n{\n  \"model\": \"claude-sonnet-4\",\n  \"maxTokens\": 4096,\n  \"permissions\": {\n    \"allowedTools\": [\"bash\", \"read\", \"write\"],\n    \"denyTools\": [\"exec\"]\n  },\n  \"hooks\": {\n    \"preToolUse\": {\n      \"matchers\": [\"*.py\"],\n      \"commands\": [\"lint\", \"format\"]\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\n#### CLAUDE.md File\nCreate a `.claude.md` file in your project root to provide:\n- Project overview and purpose\n- Architecture explanation\n- Running and testing instructions\n- Development guidelines\n- Stack information\n- This helps Claude understand your project context better\n\n---\n\n### 6. Integration with Other Tools and Services\n\n#### GitHub Integration\nClaude Code provides native GitHub integration:\n- **Can Do**: Read issues, write code, run tests, submit PRs, analyze PR changes, access GitHub APIs, work with file operations, respond to comments and reviews\n- **Cannot Do**: Submit formal PR reviews, approve PRs for security reasons, merge branches, rebase branches\n- **Automation**: Use GitHub Actions to automate PR comments and workflows\n\n#### GitLab Integration (Beta)\nCurrently maintained by GitLab and built on Claude Code CLI and SDK:\n- Instant Merge Request (MR) creation\n- Automated implementation of issues\n- Project awareness following CLAUDE.md guidelines\n- Enterprise-ready provider options\n- Secure-by-default execution\n\n#### MCP Server Integration\nConnect Claude Code to hundreds of external tools via Model Context Protocol:\n- **Issue Trackers**: Jira, Linear, GitHub Issues\n- **Databases**: Query and manipulate data\n- **APIs**: Custom REST/GraphQL endpoints\n- **Monitoring**: Analytics and performance data\n- **Design Tools**: Integration with design systems\n- **Workflows**: Custom automation scripts\n\n**Scope Levels:**\n- Local-scoped (project-specific, private to user)\n- Global-scoped (user-wide access)\n- Stdio servers (local processes with direct system access)\n\n#### Command Line Tools\nClaude Code can use any installed CLI tool:\n- Git for version control\n- npm/yarn for package management\n- Testing frameworks (pytest, Jest, etc.)\n- Linting and formatting tools\n- Build systems\n- Docker and container tools\n\n---\n\n### 7. Limitations and Important Considerations\n\n#### Usage Limits\n- **Session Duration**: 5-hour rolling session window; clock resets when you send a message after 5 hours\n- **Token Pool**: All messages and tokens during the session draw from your plan's pool\n- **Rate Limiting**: New prompts are immediately blocked when limits are reached\n- **Instant Block**: Limits are enforced immediately; conversation history remains for reference\n\n#### Context Window Limitations\n- **Standard Models**: 200K token context window\n- **Claude Sonnet 4** (Enterprise): 500K token context window\n- **Performance Degradation**: Extended sessions can slow performance as context fills\n- **Solution**: Periodically clear conversation history with `/clear` to maintain optimal performance\n\n#### File Upload Limitations\n- **Individual File Size**: Maximum 30MB per file\n- **Batch Upload Limit**: Maximum 20 files per single chat session\n\n#### Architectural Challenges\nClaude Code may have difficulty with:\n- **Event-Driven Systems**: Complex event flows and reactive architectures\n- **Microservices**: Complex communication patterns between services\n- **Cutting-Edge Frameworks**: New technologies not well-represented in training data\n- **Highly Customized Environments**: Proprietary frameworks or legacy systems\n- **Non-Standard Patterns**: Projects deviating significantly from standard practices\n\n#### Permission and Security Constraints\n- **Approval Overhead**: Permission system can slow workflows by requiring approval for file edits, commands, and Git operations\n- **Workspace Scoping**: Strict network and filesystem rules constrain write operations\n- **MR Review Requirement**: All changes must flow through a merge/pull request for reviewer approval\n\n#### Performance Considerations\n- **Startup Time**: Native binary installation offers faster startup than npm\n- **Network Dependency**: Requires active internet connection for AI interactions\n- **Billing Requirements**: Active billing on Anthropic console required for authentication\n\n---\n\n### Key Takeaways\n\nClaude Code is a powerful tool for AI-assisted development that excels at:\n- Understanding complex codebases quickly\n- Automating repetitive coding tasks\n- Integrating seamlessly with existing development workflows\n- Handling full development cycles from planning to testing\n\nHowever, success depends on:\n- Clear project documentation (CLAUDE.md)\n- Understanding its limitations with complex architectures\n- Proper configuration of hooks and settings for your workflow\n- Effective context management within session windows\n- Clear communication of requirements and constraints\n\nFor the latest features and best practices, consult the official documentation at code.claude.com/docs.\n\n---\n\n### Sources:\n- [Set up Claude Code - Claude Code Docs](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/setup)\n- [How to Install Claude Code CLI – Bind AI IDE](https://blog.getbind.co/2025/08/26/how-to-install-claude-code-cli/)\n- [Claude Code | Claude](https://claude.com/product/claude-code)\n- [Common workflows - Claude Code Docs](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/common-workflows)\n- [How Anthropic teams use Claude Code | Claude](https://www.anthropic.com/news/how-anthropic-teams-use-claude-code)\n- [Claude Code Best Practices - Anthropic](https://www.anthropic.com/engineering/claude-code-best-practices)\n- [Get started with Claude Code hooks - Claude Code Docs](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/hooks-guide)\n- [Hooks reference - Claude Docs](https://docs.claude.com/en/docs/claude-code/hooks)\n- [Claude Code GitLab CI/CD - Claude Code Docs](https://docs.claude.com/en/docs/claude-code/gitlab-ci-cd)\n- [Connect Claude Code to tools via MCP - Claude Code Docs](https://docs.claude.com/en/docs/claude-code/mcp)\n- [Claude Code Limits | ClaudeLog](https://claudelog.com/claude-code-limits/)\n- [Understanding Usage and Length Limits | Claude Help Center](https://support.claude.com/en/articles/11647753-understanding-usage-and-length-limits)"}],"stop_reason":null,"stop_sequence":null,"usage":{"input_tokens":6,"cache_creation_input_tokens":1958,"cache_read_input_tokens":16772,"cache_creation":{"ephemeral_5m_input_tokens":1958,"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens":0},"output_tokens":1,"service_tier":"standard"}},"requestId":"req_011CVXNt9pyEhrFuPKQytfB2","type":"assistant","uuid":"b9603ab0-406c-4da4-9cb3-dfb0de1f010b","timestamp":"2025-11-26T23:36:07.590Z"}
