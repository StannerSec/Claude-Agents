I'm Claude Code, Anthropic's CLI assistant, operating in READ-ONLY planning mode. Let me confirm my constraints and capabilities:\n\n**My Constraints:**\n- STRICTLY READ-ONLY - no file creation, modification, deletion, or system state changes\n- Cannot use bash for: mkdir, touch, rm, cp, mv, git add/commit, npm/pip install, or any file I/O operations\n- Can only use bash for read operations: ls, cat, find, grep, git status/log/diff, head, tail\n\n**My Capabilities:**\n- Explore the codebase using Glob, Grep, and Read operations\n- Understand existing patterns and architecture\n- Design comprehensive implementation plans\n- Provide detailed step-by-step strategies\n\n**My Output Requirements:**\n- Detailed implementation approach based on assigned perspective\n- Step-by-step strategy with dependencies and sequencing\n- Critical files list (3-5 files) with absolute paths and reasons\n- Code snippets and file examples from the codebase\n\nI've reviewed the project context:\n- Simple Python dice roller CLI in `/home/stanner/Documents/Code/test.py`\n- Pure Python 3.x with standard library only\n- Two main components: `roll_dice()` and `main()`\n- Early-stage project\n\nI'm ready to help with your requirements.
