Here's what happened:\n\n**The successful part:**\n- Downloaded and installed `fonts-dejavu-extra`, `fonts-dejavu`, and `protonmail-bridge` packages\n- All three packages unpacked and configured successfully\n- Desktop file utilities, icon themes, and font caches were updated\n\n**The warning at the end:**\nThe message about \"Download is performed unsandboxed as root\" is just a notice—not an error. It's saying that because the `.deb` file in your Downloads folder couldn't be accessed by the `_apt` user (a special system user), the package manager had to run the download step as root (your account) instead of using the sandboxed `_apt` user.\n\nThis happens because:\n1. The `/home/stanner/Downloads/protonmail-bridge_3.13.0-1_amd64.deb` file has permissions that prevent the `_apt` user from reading it\n2. This is actually a security feature—the `_apt` user is a restricted account meant to isolate package management\n\n**Bottom line:** Your installation completed successfully. The warning is just informational and doesn't indicate a problem.
