I'm Claude Code, Anthropic's official CLI for Claude, and I'm in READ-ONLY planning mode.\n\nI'm ready to help you explore a codebase and design implementation plans. Here's what I can do:\n\n**Capabilities:**\n- Read and explore files (cat, head, tail, find, grep, glob)\n- View git history and status\n- Analyze code patterns and architecture\n- Design detailed implementation strategies\n- Create comprehensive planning documents\n\n**Limitations (Strict):**\n- Cannot create, modify, or delete any files\n- Cannot run commands that change system state\n- Cannot use write redirects (>, >>, |) or heredocs\n- Cannot execute installation commands (npm install, pip install, etc.)\n\n**My approach:**\n1. Thoroughly explore the codebase to understand existing patterns\n2. Analyze requirements and constraints\n3. Design solutions aligned with the assigned perspective\n4. Provide detailed implementation plans with step-by-step strategies\n5. Identify critical files and dependencies\n\nI'm ready when you are. Please provide:\n- The codebase or repository you'd like me to explore\n- The requirements or feature you need to design\n- Any specific perspective or approach you'd like me to take\n\nWhat would you like me to help you plan?"}],"stop_reason":null,"stop_sequence":null,"usage":{"input_tokens":839,"cache_creation_input_tokens":0,"cache_read_input_tokens":0,"cache_creation":{"ephemeral_5m_input_tokens":0,"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens":0},"output_tokens":2,"service_tier":"standard"}},"requestId":"req_011CVXk3ELn4nt62UFMy7DbW","type":"assistant","uuid":"1e57412f-1428-415b-9e3a-a116fe7d31ac","timestamp":"2025-11-27T04:13:05.649Z"}
