Please provide:\n- The requirements for what needs to be implemented\n- (Optional) Any specific perspective or approach you'd like me to take\n- The codebase location to explore\n\nWhat would you like me to help design today?"}],"stop_reason":null,"stop_sequence":null,"usage":{"input_tokens":850,"cache_creation_input_tokens":0,"cache_read_input_tokens":0,"cache_creation":{"ephemeral_5m_input_tokens":0,"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens":0},"output_tokens":2,"service_tier":"standard"}},"requestId":"req_011CVVkYghM2kWNidt2H31Sp","type":"assistant","uuid":"2690eb25-cb04-4f60-8ee5-a8a9620ecbde","timestamp":"2025-11-26T02:58:38.329Z"}
