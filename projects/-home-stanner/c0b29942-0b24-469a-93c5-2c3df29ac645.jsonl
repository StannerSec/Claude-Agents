Now let me provide you with a comprehensive beginner's guide to Claude Code:\n\n## Claude Code Basics: A Beginner's Guide\n\n### 1. The Project Directory: How Claude Code Works with Your Code\n\n**What is the project directory?**\nWhen you run the `claude` command, you're launching Claude Code from your current terminal location. This directory becomes Claude Code's \"home base\" - it's where Claude operates and what it has access to.\n\n**What Claude Code can access:**\n- All files and folders in your project directory and subdirectories\n- Your entire codebase structure for understanding context\n- File systems and external tools through the terminal\n- External data sources and integrations you've configured\n\n**Key principle:** Claude Code works directly in your terminal, not through a separate chat interface. This means it can:\n- Read and edit your actual project files\n- Execute commands in your terminal\n- Create commits and manage version control\n- Follow Unix principles, so you can pipe data to it (e.g., `cat logs.txt | claude -p \"explain\"`)\n\n### 2. User Context: Understanding What Claude Knows About You\n\nYour \"user context\" in Claude Code includes:\n- Your project structure and codebase\n- Files you've been working on in this session\n- Your conversation history with Claude\n- Any custom slash commands or configurations you've set up\n- Your model preferences and settings\n- Files you've marked with `@` for quick reference\n\nClaude maintains awareness of your entire project, so when you ask questions about your code, it understands the full context.\n\n### 3. Commands You Can Run\n\nThere are three main types of commands available:\n\n#### Built-in Slash Commands (40+ available)\nThese control Claude's behavior during interactive sessions. Examples include:\n\n| Command | Purpose |\n|---------|---------|\n| `/help` | View available commands and get assistance |\n| `/model` | Check or switch your AI model |\n| `/cost` | See token usage and costs |\n| `/clear` | Clear your conversation history |\n| `/compact` | Optimize token usage |\n| `/export` | Export your conversation |\n| `/config` | View and modify configuration |\n| `/status` | Check Claude Code status |\n\n**In your project, you also have custom commands:**\n- `/init` - Initialize a new CLAUDE.md file with codebase documentation\n- `/pr-comments` - Get comments from a GitHub pull request\n- `/statusline` - Set up Claude Code's status line UI\n- `/review` - Review a pull request\n- `/security-review` - Complete a security review of pending changes\n\n#### Basic CLI Commands\nRun these from your terminal to launch Claude:\n\n```bash\n# Start interactive mode (have a conversation with Claude)\nclaude\n\n# Start with an initial question\nclaude \"explain this project\"\n\n# One-shot query (get answer and exit)\nclaude -p \"what does this function do\"\n\n# Continue your last conversation\nclaude -c\n\n# Resume a specific session\nclaude -r \"session-id\" \"continue working on...\"\n\n# Pipe data to Claude\ncat logs.txt | claude -p \"what's wrong here?\"\n\n# Update Claude Code\nclaude update\n\n# Configure MCP servers\nclaude mcp\n```\n\n#### Interactive Input Methods\nOnce inside Claude Code, you can input commands in several ways:\n\n| Prefix | Purpose | Example |\n|--------|---------|---------|\n| `/` | Slash commands | `/help` |\n| `!` | Direct bash execution | `!npm test` |\n| `@` | File path autocomplete | `@src/index.js` |\n| `#` | Memory shortcuts | Quick references to previous context |\n\n### 4. Key Concepts for New Users\n\n#### Interactive Mode Experience\nWhen you run `claude`, you enter an interactive session where you can:\n- Have back-and-forth conversations with Claude\n- Use keyboard shortcuts for navigation:\n  - **Arrow keys** - Navigate command history\n  - **Ctrl+R** - Search previous commands\n  - **Ctrl+C** - Cancel current operation\n  - **Ctrl+D** - Exit Claude Code\n  - **Ctrl+L** - Clear screen\n  - **Ctrl+O** - Toggle verbose output (see detailed tool info)\n  - **Esc+Esc** - Undo (restore code/conversation to previous state)\n  - **Tab** - Toggle extended thinking for deeper analysis\n  - **Shift+Tab** - Switch permission modes\n\n#### What Claude Can Do\nClaude Code can accomplish four main tasks:\n1. **Feature Development** - Describe what you want built, Claude creates a plan, writes code, and validates it\n2. **Bug Resolution** - Share issues/errors, Claude analyzes your codebase and fixes problems\n3. **Codebase Navigation** - Ask questions about your code structure and access external data\n4. **Task Automation** - Handle repetitive work like linting, merge conflicts, and documentation\n\n#### Multiline Input\nWhen you need to write multiple lines:\n- Use `Option+Enter` on macOS\n- Use `Shift+Enter` on Linux (after running `/terminal-setup`)\n- Use regular `Enter` to submit\n\n#### Background Task Execution\nYou can run long processes asynchronously:\n- Press `Ctrl+B` during execution to background a task\n- Claude will continue while your background task runs\n- Great for long builds, tests, or servers\n\n### 5. Your Current Setup\n\nYour configuration includes custom slash commands tailored for pull request reviews and security checks, making it easy to analyze and review code without typing long commands.\n\n---\n\n## Quick Start Example\n\nHere's a typical workflow:\n\n```bash\ncd /path/to/your/project\nclaude \"help me understand how this project is structured\"\n\n# Claude will analyze your project and explain it\n# Then you can:\n# > /help                    (see all commands)\n# > /review                  (review a PR)\n# > /security-review         (check for security issues)\n# > !npm test               (run tests)\n# > Ctrl+R                  (search previous commands)\n```\n\nThis gives you a solid foundation for using Claude Code effectively. Start by running `claude` in your project directory and try asking it to explain your codebase!"}]}]},"uuid":"0287547b-9587-4a54-8cb5-b84be88a60d1","timestamp":"2025-11-26T23:14:18.363Z","toolUseResult":{"status":"completed","prompt":"The user wants to learn the basics of how Claude Code works.

Here's a comprehensive guide to get you started with Claude Code:\n\n## **Project Directory**\nClaude Code operates from whatever directory you launch it in. Right now, I'm running in `/home/stanner`. I can access all files and folders in this directory and its subdirectories. When you run `claude`, that becomes my \"home base\" where I can read, edit, and create files.\n\n## **Current User Context**\nYou're running as user `stanner` on a Linux system. I can see your environment and execute commands with your permissions. I maintain awareness of:\n- Your project structure and files\n- Our conversation history\n- Any custom configurations you've set up\n- Files you reference with `@` mentions\n\n## **Commands You Can Run**\n\n### **Built-in Slash Commands** (use these during our chat):\n- `/help` - Get help with Claude Code\n- `/model` - Check or switch AI model\n- `/cost` - See token usage and costs\n- `/clear` - Clear conversation history\n- `/config` - View/modify configuration\n- `/status` - Check Claude Code status\n\n### **CLI Commands** (run these from your terminal):\n```bash\nclaude                    # Start interactive mode\nclaude \"your question\"    # Start with a question\nclaude -p \"query\"        # One-shot query and exit\nclaude -c                # Continue last conversation\nclaude update            # Update Claude Code\nclaude mcp               # Configure MCP servers\n```\n\n### **Interactive Input**:\n- `/command` - Slash commands\n- `!npm test` - Direct bash execution with `!`\n- `@filename` - File path autocomplete\n- `Ctrl+O` - Toggle verbose output\n- `Esc+Esc` - Undo recent changes\n- `Tab` - Toggle extended thinking\n- `Ctrl+D` - Exit Claude Code\n\n## **What I Can Do**\n1. **Build features** - You describe it, I plan and implement it\n2. **Fix bugs** - Share errors, I'll analyze and fix them\n3. **Navigate code** - Ask me about your codebase structure\n4. **Automate tasks** - Handle linting, conflicts, docs, etc.\n\n## **Quick Example**\n```bash\ncd /home/stanner/my-project\nclaude \"explain the project structure\"\n# Then in the interactive session:\n# > /help           (see commands)\n# > !ls -la         (run bash commands)\n# > Ctrl+D          (exit when done)\n```\n\nWhat would you like to explore or work on?"}],"stop_reason":null,"stop_sequence":null,"usage":{"input_tokens":7,"cache_creation_input_tokens":1850,"cache_read_input_tokens":17785,"cache_creation":{"ephemeral_5m_input_tokens":1850,"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens":0},"output_tokens":1,"service_tier":"standard"}},"requestId":"req_011CVXMG1iSkVPXEkQJ6W8Up","type":"assistant","uuid":"27313f31-4e99-49f0-a955-ed74df72c06b","timestamp":"2025-11-26T23:14:34.377Z"}

Now I have comprehensive information. Let me provide you with a complete guide:\n\n## When to Run Claude from a Specific Project Directory vs. Home Directory\n\nBased on the official Claude Code documentation, here's the practical guidance:\n\n### 1. **When to Establish a Project Directory (cd into your project)**\n\nYou should cd into a specific project directory when:\n\n- **Working on an actual codebase**: You're developing, debugging, or modifying code within a repository. This ensures Claude Code can discover and use project-specific context.\n\n- **You need project-specific configuration**: Your project requires custom permissions, environment variables, or settings stored in `.claude/settings.json` or `.claude/settings.local.json`.\n\n- **You're using project memory (CLAUDE.md)**: If your project or team has established documentation via CLAUDE.md files, you need to be in the project directory (or a subdirectory of it) for Claude to discover and load this context.\n\n- **You're using custom slash commands or agents**: If your team has defined project-specific commands in `.claude/commands/` or agents in `.claude/agents/`, you need to be in the project directory for these to be available.\n\n- **You're collaborating with a team**: Project-level configuration is shared with teammates via source control, ensuring consistent workflows.\n\n**Example scenarios:**\n- You're fixing a bug in a web application at `/home/user/projects/my-webapp`\n- You're building a feature in a monorepo at `/home/user/monorepo/services/api`\n- You're working on a shared codebase where the team has set up project memory and custom commands\n\n### 2. **When It's Okay to Run from Home Directory or Elsewhere**\n\nYou can run Claude from your home directory or arbitrary locations when:\n\n- **Quick, one-off tasks**: You're doing a simple script, learning a concept, or experimenting with something that doesn't relate to a specific project.\n\n- **Using global settings only**: You only need the universal settings from `~/.claude/settings.json` that apply across all projects.\n\n- **Cross-project analysis**: You're analyzing code patterns across multiple projects and don't need project-specific context.\n\n- **General assistance**: You're asking Claude for help that isn't tied to a particular codebase (e.g., explaining concepts, writing documentation).\n\n**Example scenarios:**\n- You're writing a quick Python script for personal use\n- You're learning how to use a new library without a specific project\n- You're getting general programming advice\n- You're testing Claude Code features\n\n### 3. **Best Practices for Organizing Work with Claude Code**\n\n**Project Root Navigation:**\nAlways navigate to your project root directory before starting a Claude Code session. This ensures Claude discovers all relevant context files recursively as it walks up the directory tree.\n\n**Memory File Discovery:**\nClaude Code searches for CLAUDE.md or CLAUDE.local.md files starting in your current working directory and recursing up to (but not including) the root filesystem. Example directory structure:\n\n```\n/home/user/monorepo/\n├── CLAUDE.md                    (discovered from monorepo level)\n├── services/\n│   ├── api/\n│   │   ├── CLAUDE.md            (discovered from api directory)\n│   │   └── src/\n│   │       └── (your code)\n│   └── web/\n│       └── (your code)\n```\n\nIf you're working in `/home/user/monorepo/services/api/src`, Claude will load both the monorepo-level and api-level CLAUDE.md files.\n\n**Configuration Organization:**\n```\nyour-project/\n├── .claude/\n│   ├── settings.json            (team-shared project settings)\n│   ├── settings.local.json       (your personal project settings)\n│   ├── commands/                 (custom slash commands)\n│   └── agents/                   (custom agents)\n├── CLAUDE.md                     (project memory/documentation)\n└── (your code)\n```\n\n**Parallel Work with Git Worktrees:**\nUse Git worktrees for simultaneous tasks on different branches:\n```bash\ngit worktree add ../my-project-feature-x branch-name\n```\nEach worktree has its own independent file state, perfect for parallel Claude Code sessions without interference.\n\n### 4. **Implications of Running from Different Directories**\n\n**Project Directory (cd into your project):**\n- All project-specific settings, commands, agents, and memory are available\n- Claude has full context about your codebase structure\n- Permissions and environment variables are properly scoped\n- File references are resolved relative to the project root\n- Better for focused, context-aware work\n\n**Subdirectory within a project (e.g., `project/src/components/`):**\n- Claude still discovers project memory and settings by walking up to the project root\n- Terminal commands run from that subdirectory (though Claude Code resets the working directory between bash calls by default)\n- May limit Claude's automatic file context discovery\n- Less ideal than starting from project root\n\n**Home directory or unrelated locations:**\n- No project-specific context is loaded\n- Only global settings from `~/.claude/settings.json` apply\n- No custom commands or agents specific to any project\n- Better for standalone work unrelated to specific projects\n\n### 5. **How Claude Code Behavior Changes Based on Working Directory**\n\n**File Context Discovery:**\nWhen you provide files to Claude, the directory structure matters. Starting from the project root ensures Claude understands the full project architecture and can make better decisions about file relationships.\n\n**Bash Command Execution:**\nClaude Code has a mechanism (`CLAUDE_BASH_MAINTAIN_PROJECT_WORKING_DIR`) that returns to the original working directory after bash commands. This prevents accidental directory changes from affecting subsequent commands.\n\n**Memory Hierarchy:**\nProject-level memories (CLAUDE.md) take precedence over user-level and enterprise-level memories. Working from the correct project directory ensures the right memory files are loaded.\n\n**Permission Scoping:**\nPermissions defined in `.claude/settings.json` at your project root apply to that project. Working from the project directory ensures these security controls are active.\n\n## Quick Decision Tree\n\n```\nAre you working on a specific codebase?\n├─ Yes → cd into the project directory (ideally at root)\n└─ No → Safe to run from home directory or elsewhere\n\nDoes your project have custom setup (.claude/ directory)?\n├─ Yes → Must cd into the project directory\n└─ No → Running from anywhere still works, but project root is recommended\n\nIs this a standalone, one-off task?\n├─ Yes → Home directory is fine\n└─ No → Use the appropriate project directory\n```\n\n## Practical Examples\n\n**Scenario 1: Web Development**\n```bash\ncd /home/user/projects/my-webapp    # Navigate to project\nclaude                               # Start Claude Code with full context\n```\n\n**Scenario 2: Quick Script**\n```bash\ncd ~                                 # Stay in home directory\nclaude                               # Start Claude for a quick task\n```\n\n**Scenario 3: Monorepo Work**\n```bash\ncd /home/user/monorepo               # Start at monorepo root (or service root)\nclaude                               # Discovers all relevant CLAUDE.md files\n```\n\n**Scenario 4: Multiple Parallel Work**\n```bash\n# Main branch work\ncd /home/user/my-project && claude\n\n# Parallel work on feature branch\ncd /home/user/my-project-feature-x && claude   # Using git worktree\n```\n\nThe key takeaway: **Always cd into your project directory for actual project work** to ensure Claude has access to project-specific context, settings, and configurations. Use home directory or arbitrary locations only for standalone tasks unrelated to specific codebases."}]}]},"uuid":"2ca8050f-6beb-4dda-b7a6-84022082c877","timestamp":"2025-11-26T23:24:43.509Z","toolUseResult":{"status":"completed","prompt":"The user is asking when they should establish a project directory (cd into a specific project) versus just using their user home directory when working with Claude Code. \n\nPlease explain:\n1.

Example directory structure:\n\n```\n/home/user/monorepo/\n├── CLAUDE.md                    (discovered from monorepo level)\n├── services/\n│   ├── api/\n│   │   ├── CLAUDE.md            (discovered from api directory)\n│   │   └── src/\n│   │       └── (your code)\n│   └── web/\n│       └── (your code)\n```\n\nIf you're working in `/home/user/monorepo/services/api/src`, Claude will load both the monorepo-level and api-level CLAUDE.md files.\n\n**Configuration Organization:**\n```\nyour-project/\n├── .claude/\n│   ├── settings.json            (team-shared project settings)\n│   ├── settings.local.json       (your personal project settings)\n│   ├── commands/                 (custom slash commands)\n│   └── agents/                   (custom agents)\n├── CLAUDE.md                     (project memory/documentation)\n└── (your code)\n```\n\n**Parallel Work with Git Worktrees:**\nUse Git worktrees for simultaneous tasks on different branches:\n```bash\ngit worktree add ../my-project-feature-x branch-name\n```\nEach worktree has its own independent file state, perfect for parallel Claude Code sessions without interference.\n\n### 4. **Implications of Running from Different Directories**\n\n**Project Directory (cd into your project):**\n- All project-specific settings, commands, agents, and memory are available\n- Claude has full context about your codebase structure\n- Permissions and environment variables are properly scoped\n- File references are resolved relative to the project root\n- Better for focused, context-aware work\n\n**Subdirectory within a project (e.g., `project/src/components/`):**\n- Claude still discovers project memory and settings by walking up to the project root\n- Terminal commands run from that subdirectory (though Claude Code resets the working directory between bash calls by default)\n- May limit Claude's automatic file context discovery\n- Less ideal than starting from project root\n\n**Home directory or unrelated locations:**\n- No project-specific context is loaded\n- Only global settings from `~/.claude/settings.json` apply\n- No custom commands or agents specific to any project\n- Better for standalone work unrelated to specific projects\n\n### 5. **How Claude Code Behavior Changes Based on Working Directory**\n\n**File Context Discovery:**\nWhen you provide files to Claude, the directory structure matters. Starting from the project root ensures Claude understands the full project architecture and can make better decisions about file relationships.\n\n**Bash Command Execution:**\nClaude Code has a mechanism (`CLAUDE_BASH_MAINTAIN_PROJECT_WORKING_DIR`) that returns to the original working directory after bash commands. This prevents accidental directory changes from affecting subsequent commands.\n\n**Memory Hierarchy:**\nProject-level memories (CLAUDE.md) take precedence over user-level and enterprise-level memories. Working from the correct project directory ensures the right memory files are loaded.\n\n**Permission Scoping:**\nPermissions defined in `.claude/settings.json` at your project root apply to that project. Working from the project directory ensures these security controls are active.\n\n## Quick Decision Tree\n\n```\nAre you working on a specific codebase?\n├─ Yes → cd into the project directory (ideally at root)\n└─ No → Safe to run from home directory or elsewhere\n\nDoes your project have custom setup (.claude/ directory)?\n├─ Yes → Must cd into the project directory\n└─ No → Running from anywhere still works, but project root is recommended\n\nIs this a standalone, one-off task?\n├─ Yes → Home directory is fine\n└─ No → Use the appropriate project directory\n```\n\n## Practical Examples\n\n**Scenario 1: Web Development**\n```bash\ncd /home/user/projects/my-webapp    # Navigate to project\nclaude                               # Start Claude Code with full context\n```\n\n**Scenario 2: Quick Script**\n```bash\ncd ~                                 # Stay in home directory\nclaude                               # Start Claude for a quick task\n```\n\n**Scenario 3: Monorepo Work**\n```bash\ncd /home/user/monorepo               # Start at monorepo root (or service root)\nclaude                               # Discovers all relevant CLAUDE.md files\n```\n\n**Scenario 4: Multiple Parallel Work**\n```bash\n# Main branch work\ncd /home/user/my-project && claude\n\n# Parallel work on feature branch\ncd /home/user/my-project-feature-x && claude   # Using git worktree\n```\n\nThe key takeaway: **Always cd into your project directory for actual project work** to ensure Claude has access to project-specific context, settings, and configurations. Use home directory or arbitrary locations only for standalone tasks unrelated to specific codebases."}],"totalDurationMs":32148,"totalTokens":8123,"totalToolUseCount":6,"usage":{"input_tokens":6,"cache_creation_input_tokens":1384,"cache_read_input_tokens":4940,"cache_creation":{"ephemeral_5m_input_tokens":1384,"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens":0},"output_tokens":1793,"service_tier":"standard"}}}

This file provides Claude with context about your project structure, conventions, dependencies, and other relevant information. It acts as a guide for Claude to better understand your codebase.\n\n---\n\n### 2. **User Context vs. Project Context**\n\nClaude Code distinguishes between two scopes:\n\n**User Context (Personal - `~/.claude/`)**\n- Settings and configurations applied across all your projects\n- Personal preferences that persist regardless of which project you're working in\n- Files stored here show as \"(user)\" in help displays\n- Available on your personal machine\n\n**Project Context (Team/Collaborative - `.claude/` in project root)**\n- Settings specific to a particular project\n- Shared with team members when committed to version control\n- Files stored here show as \"(project)\" in help displays\n- Applied only when working in that specific project directory\n\n---\n\n### 3. **How `/init` Behaves in Each Context**\n\n**When run from the home directory (`/home/stanner`)**\n- Would typically create or update a user-level `CLAUDE.md`\n- Located at: `/home/stanner/CLAUDE.md`\n- Serves as default documentation for any project on your system that doesn't have its own project-specific CLAUDE.md\n- Contains general information about your coding practices, tools, and preferences\n\n**When run from a project directory**\n- Creates a project-specific `CLAUDE.md`\n- Located at: `/path/to/your/project/CLAUDE.md`\n- Analyzes the codebase in that directory and generates documentation specific to that project\n- Overrides or complements any user-level CLAUDE.md when working in that project\n\n---\n\n### 4. **Files Created and Their Locations**\n\n**Primary Output File:**\n- **User-level**: `/home/stanner/CLAUDE.md`\n- **Project-level**: `./CLAUDE.md` (in the project root)\n\n**Optional Supporting Structure:**\n- **User commands**: `~/.claude/commands/` (personal custom slash commands)\n- **Project commands**: `./.claude/commands/` (project-specific custom slash commands)\n- Both locations can contain additional configuration files\n\n---\n\n### 5. **Key Differences Between User-Level and Project-Level Initialization**\n\n| Aspect | User-Level (/init from ~) | Project-Level (/init from project) |\n|--------|---------------------------|-----------------------------------|\n| **Scope** | Applies to all projects | Specific to one project |\n| **Location** | `CLAUDE.md` in home dir | `.claude/` or `CLAUDE.md` in project root |\n| **Content** | General coding practices, setup instructions | Project architecture, tech stack, codebase specifics |\n| **Visibility** | Shared across all Claude Code sessions | Only used in that project directory |\n| **Version Control** | Typically not committed (personal) | Usually committed to git (team-shared) |\n| **Priority** | Lower precedence | Higher precedence (overrides user-level) |\n\n---\n\n### 6. **Best Practices for When to Use `/init` in Each Context**\n\n**Use User-Level `/init` When:**\n- Setting up Claude Code for the first time\n- You want to establish consistent defaults across all your projects\n- You have personal coding standards, naming conventions, or tool preferences\n- You want to document your development environment setup\n- Creating a personal knowledge base that applies everywhere\n\n**Use Project-Level `/init` When:**\n- Starting a new team project or taking over an existing one\n- You want project-specific context that differs from your personal setup\n- The project has unique architecture, dependencies, or conventions\n- You plan to commit the CLAUDE.md to version control for team collaboration\n- Each project needs distinct documentation for Claude to understand\n\n---\n\n### 7. **Example Usage Scenarios**\n\n**Scenario 1: Setting up personally (User Context)**\n```bash\ncd ~\n/init\n# Creates: /home/stanner/CLAUDE.md\n# Contains: Personal coding standards, tools you use, general preferences\n```\n\n**Scenario 2: Starting a new project (Project Context)**\n```bash\ncd /path/to/my-awesome-app\n/init\n# Creates: /path/to/my-awesome-app/CLAUDE.md or .claude/\n# Contains: Project structure, tech stack, API details, database schema\n```\n\n**Scenario 3: Working in a project with both levels**\n```bash\n# User CLAUDE.md provides baseline context\n# Project CLAUDE.md adds project-specific details\n# Project-level context takes precedence when in that directory\n```\n\n---\n\n### 8. **Related Information**\n\nThe `/init` command works alongside other commands in your custom setup:\n- **/context**: Likely allows you to view or manage project context\n- **/review**: Works better when project context from `/init` has been established\n- **/pr-comments**: Can reference context established by `/init`\n\nWhen you run `/init`, it analyzes your codebase (if in a project) to understand its structure and generate relevant documentation that Claude can reference in subsequent interactions.\n\n---\n\nWould you like me to help you run the `/init` command in a specific context, or do you have questions about how to best use this in your current projects?"}]}]},"uuid":"9c20e7cc-ff0f-4bbf-b26e-e1cb5efb2249","timestamp":"2025-11-26T23:27:13.351Z","toolUseResult":{"status":"completed","prompt":"The user wants to understand what the /init command does in user context versus project context. \n\nPlease explain:\n1.

This file provides Claude with context about your project structure, conventions, dependencies, and other relevant information. It acts as a guide for Claude to better understand your codebase.\n\n---\n\n### 2. **User Context vs. Project Context**\n\nClaude Code distinguishes between two scopes:\n\n**User Context (Personal - `~/.claude/`)**\n- Settings and configurations applied across all your projects\n- Personal preferences that persist regardless of which project you're working in\n- Files stored here show as \"(user)\" in help displays\n- Available on your personal machine\n\n**Project Context (Team/Collaborative - `.claude/` in project root)**\n- Settings specific to a particular project\n- Shared with team members when committed to version control\n- Files stored here show as \"(project)\" in help displays\n- Applied only when working in that specific project directory\n\n---\n\n### 3. **How `/init` Behaves in Each Context**\n\n**When run from the home directory (`/home/stanner`)**\n- Would typically create or update a user-level `CLAUDE.md`\n- Located at: `/home/stanner/CLAUDE.md`\n- Serves as default documentation for any project on your system that doesn't have its own project-specific CLAUDE.md\n- Contains general information about your coding practices, tools, and preferences\n\n**When run from a project directory**\n- Creates a project-specific `CLAUDE.md`\n- Located at: `/path/to/your/project/CLAUDE.md`\n- Analyzes the codebase in that directory and generates documentation specific to that project\n- Overrides or complements any user-level CLAUDE.md when working in that project\n\n---\n\n### 4. **Files Created and Their Locations**\n\n**Primary Output File:**\n- **User-level**: `/home/stanner/CLAUDE.md`\n- **Project-level**: `./CLAUDE.md` (in the project root)\n\n**Optional Supporting Structure:**\n- **User commands**: `~/.claude/commands/` (personal custom slash commands)\n- **Project commands**: `./.claude/commands/` (project-specific custom slash commands)\n- Both locations can contain additional configuration files\n\n---\n\n### 5. **Key Differences Between User-Level and Project-Level Initialization**\n\n| Aspect | User-Level (/init from ~) | Project-Level (/init from project) |\n|--------|---------------------------|-----------------------------------|\n| **Scope** | Applies to all projects | Specific to one project |\n| **Location** | `CLAUDE.md` in home dir | `.claude/` or `CLAUDE.md` in project root |\n| **Content** | General coding practices, setup instructions | Project architecture, tech stack, codebase specifics |\n| **Visibility** | Shared across all Claude Code sessions | Only used in that project directory |\n| **Version Control** | Typically not committed (personal) | Usually committed to git (team-shared) |\n| **Priority** | Lower precedence | Higher precedence (overrides user-level) |\n\n---\n\n### 6. **Best Practices for When to Use `/init` in Each Context**\n\n**Use User-Level `/init` When:**\n- Setting up Claude Code for the first time\n- You want to establish consistent defaults across all your projects\n- You have personal coding standards, naming conventions, or tool preferences\n- You want to document your development environment setup\n- Creating a personal knowledge base that applies everywhere\n\n**Use Project-Level `/init` When:**\n- Starting a new team project or taking over an existing one\n- You want project-specific context that differs from your personal setup\n- The project has unique architecture, dependencies, or conventions\n- You plan to commit the CLAUDE.md to version control for team collaboration\n- Each project needs distinct documentation for Claude to understand\n\n---\n\n### 7. **Example Usage Scenarios**\n\n**Scenario 1: Setting up personally (User Context)**\n```bash\ncd ~\n/init\n# Creates: /home/stanner/CLAUDE.md\n# Contains: Personal coding standards, tools you use, general preferences\n```\n\n**Scenario 2: Starting a new project (Project Context)**\n```bash\ncd /path/to/my-awesome-app\n/init\n# Creates: /path/to/my-awesome-app/CLAUDE.md or .claude/\n# Contains: Project structure, tech stack, API details, database schema\n```\n\n**Scenario 3: Working in a project with both levels**\n```bash\n# User CLAUDE.md provides baseline context\n# Project CLAUDE.md adds project-specific details\n# Project-level context takes precedence when in that directory\n```\n\n---\n\n### 8. **Related Information**\n\nThe `/init` command works alongside other commands in your custom setup:\n- **/context**: Likely allows you to view or manage project context\n- **/review**: Works better when project context from `/init` has been established\n- **/pr-comments**: Can reference context established by `/init`\n\nWhen you run `/init`, it analyzes your codebase (if in a project) to understand its structure and generate relevant documentation that Claude can reference in subsequent interactions.\n\n---\n\nWould you like me to help you run the `/init` command in a specific context, or do you have questions about how to best use this in your current projects?"}],"totalDurationMs":47092,"totalTokens":16510,"totalToolUseCount":13,"usage":{"input_tokens":36,"cache_creation_input_tokens":612,"cache_read_input_tokens":14551,"cache_creation":{"ephemeral_5m_input_tokens":612,"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens":0},"output_tokens":1311,"service_tier":"standard"}}}

This is important for:\n- Helping Claude understand your project architecture\n- Providing consistent context across sessions\n- Enabling better assistance from Claude Code\n\n### Step 4: Create Your Project Structure\n\nSet up the directories and files for your project type:\n\n**For a Node.js/JavaScript project:**\n```bash\nmkdir src\nmkdir tests\ntouch package.json\ntouch .gitignore\n```\n\n**For a Python project:**\n```bash\nmkdir src\nmkdir tests\ntouch requirements.txt\ntouch .gitignore\n```\n\n**For a general project:**\n```bash\nmkdir src\nmkdir docs\nmkdir tests\ntouch README.md\ntouch .gitignore\n```\n\n### Step 5: Configure Claude Code (Optional)\n\nCreate a `.claude/` directory if you need custom slash commands or advanced configuration:\n\n```bash\nmkdir .claude\n```\n\nYou can then create custom command files and configuration as needed.\n\n### Step 6: Create a .gitignore\n\nAdd a `.gitignore` file to exclude unnecessary files:\n\n```\nnode_modules/\n*.pyc\n__pycache__/\n.env\ndist/\nbuild/\n```\n\n## Available Custom Commands for Your Project\n\nOnce your project is set up, you can use your configured commands:\n\n- **`/init`** - Initialize CLAUDE.md documentation\n- **`/review`** - Review pull requests (requires git repo)\n- **`/pr-comments`** - Get GitHub PR comments\n- **`/security-review`** - Perform security reviews on pending changes\n- **`/statusline`** - Set up Claude Code's status line UI\n\n## Best Practices\n\n1. **Always initialize git first** - This enables version control features and git-based commands\n2. **Use `/init` to document your project** - This helps Claude understand your architecture\n3. **Keep your CLAUDE.md updated** - Update it as your project structure changes\n4. **Use meaningful directory structure** - Organize your code logically (src/, tests/, docs/, etc.)\n5. **Commit frequently** - This helps track changes and use the `/review` command effectively\n\n## Typical Project Creation Workflow\n\n```bash\n# 1. Create directory\nmkdir my-project\ncd my-project\n\n# 2. Initialize git\ngit init\n\n# 3. Create basic structure\nmkdir src\nmkdir tests\nmkdir docs\n\n# 4. Initialize Claude Code\n/init\n\n# 5. Create initial files\ntouch README.md\ntouch .gitignore\n\n# 6.

This is important for:\n- Helping Claude understand your project architecture\n- Providing consistent context across sessions\n- Enabling better assistance from Claude Code\n\n### Step 4: Create Your Project Structure\n\nSet up the directories and files for your project type:\n\n**For a Node.js/JavaScript project:**\n```bash\nmkdir src\nmkdir tests\ntouch package.json\ntouch .gitignore\n```\n\n**For a Python project:**\n```bash\nmkdir src\nmkdir tests\ntouch requirements.txt\ntouch .gitignore\n```\n\n**For a general project:**\n```bash\nmkdir src\nmkdir docs\nmkdir tests\ntouch README.md\ntouch .gitignore\n```\n\n### Step 5: Configure Claude Code (Optional)\n\nCreate a `.claude/` directory if you need custom slash commands or advanced configuration:\n\n```bash\nmkdir .claude\n```\n\nYou can then create custom command files and configuration as needed.\n\n### Step 6: Create a .gitignore\n\nAdd a `.gitignore` file to exclude unnecessary files:\n\n```\nnode_modules/\n*.pyc\n__pycache__/\n.env\ndist/\nbuild/\n```\n\n## Available Custom Commands for Your Project\n\nOnce your project is set up, you can use your configured commands:\n\n- **`/init`** - Initialize CLAUDE.md documentation\n- **`/review`** - Review pull requests (requires git repo)\n- **`/pr-comments`** - Get GitHub PR comments\n- **`/security-review`** - Perform security reviews on pending changes\n- **`/statusline`** - Set up Claude Code's status line UI\n\n## Best Practices\n\n1. **Always initialize git first** - This enables version control features and git-based commands\n2. **Use `/init` to document your project** - This helps Claude understand your architecture\n3. **Keep your CLAUDE.md updated** - Update it as your project structure changes\n4. **Use meaningful directory structure** - Organize your code logically (src/, tests/, docs/, etc.)\n5. **Commit frequently** - This helps track changes and use the `/review` command effectively\n\n## Typical Project Creation Workflow\n\n```bash\n# 1. Create directory\nmkdir my-project\ncd my-project\n\n# 2. Initialize git\ngit init\n\n# 3. Create basic structure\nmkdir src\nmkdir tests\nmkdir docs\n\n# 4. Initialize Claude Code\n/init\n\n# 5. Create initial files\ntouch README.md\ntouch .gitignore\n\n# 6. Make first commit\ngit add .\ngit commit -m \"Initial project setup\"\n```\n\nThis workflow sets up a project that's ready to work with Claude Code effectively, with proper documentation, version control, and the ability to use all your configured custom commands."}],"totalDurationMs":16844,"totalTokens":6122,"totalToolUseCount":5,"usage":{"input_tokens":6,"cache_creation_input_tokens":212,"cache_read_input_tokens":5080,"cache_creation":{"ephemeral_5m_input_tokens":212,"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens":0},"output_tokens":824,"service_tier":"standard"}}}
