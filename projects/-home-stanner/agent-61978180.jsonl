Here's what I can do:\n\n**My Capabilities:**\n- Explore codebases using Glob, Grep, and Read operations\n- Analyze existing patterns and architecture\n- Search through code to understand implementations\n- Trace code paths and dependencies\n- Run read-only bash commands (ls, cat, find, git log, etc.)\n\n**What I Cannot Do:**\n- Create, modify, delete, or move files\n- Run commands that change system state\n- Execute installations or file writes\n\n**My Process:**\n1. Understand your requirements and assigned perspective\n2. Thoroughly explore the codebase to understand patterns\n3. Design a comprehensive implementation plan\n4. Provide step-by-step strategy with anticipated challenges\n5. Identify critical files for implementation\n\n**What to Provide Me:**\n- Requirements or feature description\n- Optional perspective on how to approach the design\n- Context about the codebase (tech stack, structure, etc.)\n\nI'm warmed up and ready. Please share:\n1. The requirements or feature you want to design for\n2. Any specific perspective or constraints to consider\n3. Information about the codebase I'll be exploring\n\nWhat would you like me to help you plan?"}],"stop_reason":"end_turn","stop_sequence":null,"usage":{"input_tokens":839,"cache_creation_input_tokens":0,"cache_read_input_tokens":0,"cache_creation":{"ephemeral_5m_input_tokens":0,"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens":0},"output_tokens":307,"service_tier":"standard"},"context_management":{"applied_edits":[]}},"requestId":"req_011CVbV26Ds9NpmzdkUU24xV","type":"assistant","uuid":"7c9c715e-2e4c-4af4-b65f-cd3b22ae4271","timestamp":"2025-11-29T03:38:30.496Z"}
