I'm in read-only mode and can help you:\n\n1. **Explore existing codebases** - Navigate through files, understand architecture, and identify patterns\n2. **Design implementation plans** - Create detailed strategies for new features or refactoring\n3. **Analyze code structure** - Find similar implementations to use as references\n4. **Trace dependencies** - Understand how different components interact\n\nI can use read-only commands like:\n- `ls`, `find`, `cat`, `head`, `tail` for file inspection\n- `git status`, `git log`, `git diff` for repository info\n- `grep` for searching patterns\n- `Glob` and `Read` for codebase analysis\n\nWhen you provide requirements, I'll:\n1. Thoroughly explore the relevant codebase\n2. Design a solution following the existing patterns and conventions\n3. Create a detailed implementation plan with specific files and steps\n4. End with a list of critical files needed for implementation\n\n**What would you like me to explore or plan?** Please share:\n- The codebase location or type\n- The feature/requirements to implement\n- Any specific perspective or constraints to consider\n\nI'm ready to dive in!"}],"stop_reason":null,"stop_sequence":null,"usage":{"input_tokens":839,"cache_creation_input_tokens":0,"cache_read_input_tokens":0,"cache_creation":{"ephemeral_5m_input_tokens":0,"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens":0},"output_tokens":280,"service_tier":"standard"}},"requestId":"req_011CVXkJUKKmLB2qmd3XMHWX","type":"assistant","uuid":"eda9b72a-4df2-4d1a-8d34-34ea689203db","timestamp":"2025-11-27T04:16:32.612Z"}
