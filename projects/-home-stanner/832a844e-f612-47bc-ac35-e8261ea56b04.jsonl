Use:\n- Simple, everyday words\n- Concrete examples and analogies\n- Comparisons to things kids understand\n- Short sentences\n- Repetition of key ideas\n\n**Example - Encryption:**\n\"Imagine you have a secret message you want to send to your friend. You write it in a special code that only your friend knows how to read. If someone else finds the message, they can't understand it because they don't know the code. That's like encryption—you scramble your information so only the right person can read it.\"\n\n### Level 2: High School Level\n**Purpose**: Use appropriate terminology but explain clearly:\n- Introduce relevant technical terms\n- Explain each term as you use it\n- Use examples that a smart high schooler would understand\n- Show relationships between concepts\n- Keep explanations accessible without oversimplifying\n\n**Example - Encryption:**\n\"Encryption is a process where readable data (plaintext) is converted into unreadable form (ciphertext) using an algorithm and a key. Only someone with the correct key can decrypt the ciphertext back into plaintext. This protects data by making it useless to anyone who doesn't have the key, even if they intercept it.\"\n\n### Level 3: Expert/Technical Level\n**Purpose**: Include nuance, edge cases, and precise language:\n- Use precise technical terminology\n- Discuss implementation details\n- Acknowledge complexity and tradeoffs\n- Reference relevant standards or algorithms\n- Discuss security implications and considerations\n\n**Example - Encryption:**\n\"Encryption employs cryptographic algorithms (symmetric or asymmetric) to transform plaintext into ciphertext. Symmetric encryption (AES, DES) uses a shared secret key for both encryption and decryption, offering high performance but requiring secure key exchange. Asymmetric encryption (RSA, ECC) uses public-private key pairs, enabling secure key exchange but with higher computational cost. Modern security architectures often employ hybrid approaches, using asymmetric encryption for key exchange and symmetric encryption for bulk data protection.\"\n\n## The Testing Process\n\nFor each concept, create all three explanations:\n\n1. **First, write the ELI5 version**\n   - If you struggle here, you don't understand the core concept\n   - Work until it's simple and clear\n\n2. **Then, write the high school version**\n   - This should flow naturally from the ELI5 version\n   - Add terminology and detail\n\n3. **Finally, write the expert version**\n   - Build on the previous level with nuance and precision\n   - Include technical details and considerations\n\n4. **Check for gaps**\n   - If you can't explain at one level, that's where understanding is weak\n   - Go back and study that aspect more\n\n## Output Format\n\n```\nCONCEPT: [Concept name]\n════════════════════════════════════════════\n\nLEVEL 1: EXPLAIN LIKE I'M 5\n───────────────────────────\n[Simple, accessible explanation]\n\nCore analogy or comparison:\n[The key analogy that makes this understandable]\n\nKey insight at this level:\n[What a 5-year-old should understand]\n\n═══════════════════════════════════════════\n\nLEVEL 2: HIGH SCHOOL STUDENT\n──────────────────────────────\n[Clear explanation with appropriate terminology]\n\nKey terms introduced:\n- [Term 1]: [Definition]\n- [Term 2]: [Definition]\n\nReal-world example:\n[Example a high schooler would relate to]\n\nConnection to other concepts:\n[How this relates to other things they know]\n\n═══════════════════════════════════════════\n\nLEVEL 3: EXPERT/TECHNICAL\n──────────────────────────\n[Precise technical explanation]\n\nTechnical considerations:\n- [Consideration 1]\n- [Consideration 2]\n- [Consideration 3]\n\nImplementation details:\n[Specific algorithms, standards, or approaches]\n\nTradeoffs and limitations:\n[Nuance about when and how this is used]\n\nSecurity implications:\n[Relevant security considerations]\n\n═══════════════════════════════════════════\n\nUNDERSTANDING ASSESSMENT\n─────────────────────────\nConfidence level: [Based on difficulty explaining at each level]\n- Level 1 clarity: [Easy/Moderate/Difficult]\n- Level 2 clarity: [Easy/Moderate/Difficult]\n- Level 3 clarity: [Easy/Moderate/Difficult]\n\nIdentified gaps:\n[If any level was difficult, what specifically is unclear?]\n\nNext steps for deepening:\n[Specific areas to study more]\n\n═══════════════════════════════════════════\n\nANKI CARD POTENTIAL\n────────────────────\nBest question formulation:\n[This testing helps formulate better Anki questions]\n\nExplanation-based card:\nQ: [Question requiring explanation at appropriate level]\nA: [Answer that emphasizes understanding]\n```\n\n## Key Guidelines\n\n- **Start with ELI5**: If you can't do this, your understanding isn't deep enough\n- **Use analogies**: Analogies are crucial for simplification\n- **Avoid jargon creep**: Don't accidentally use technical terms in Level 1\n- **Build progressively**: Each level builds on the previous one\n- **Be honest**: If you struggle at a level, note it and study that aspect more\n- **Use examples**: Each level should include concrete examples\n- **Don't oversimplify**: Level 3 should still be accurate and complete\n\n## Process\n\n1.

Are old cards stable?\n- **Card design issues**: Are some cards worded unclearly or too ambiguous?\n- **Concept mastery gaps**: Do related cards show the same weakness?\n\n### Step 3: Categorize Cards\nClassify cards into:\n1. **Mastered**: High retention, long intervals (maybe extend intervals)\n2. **Stable**: Good retention, normal intervals (keep current schedule)\n3. **At-risk**: Declining performance, needs intervention\n4. **Failing**: Low retention despite high review count (needs redesign or more study)\n5. **Unstable**: Inconsistent performance (needs clarification or better cards)\n\n### Step 4: Diagnose Root Causes\nFor problematic cards, determine why:\n- **Card design problem**: Ambiguous wording? Too complex? Test this by redesigning\n- **Concept gap**: Don't understand the material. Need deeper study before card will stick\n- **Simple difficulty**: Just hard to remember. May need more examples or connections\n- **Interference**: Similar cards confusing you. May need clearer differentiation\n- **Timing issue**: Card interval is optimized for a different retention goal\n\n### Step 5: Create Optimization Plan\nDesign a strategy that:\n- Increases review frequency for at-risk cards\n- Extends intervals for well-mastered cards\n- Isolates failing cards for redesign/deeper study\n- Connects related concepts better\n- Balances review load across topics\n- Prioritizes high-value/high-weight topics\n- Allocates study time proportionally to importance and difficulty\n\n## Output Structure\n\n```\nSPACED REPETITION ANALYSIS\n════════════════════════════\n\nOVERVIEW\n────────\nCurrent status:\n- Total cards: [number]\n- Overall retention rate: [percentage]\n- Average review interval: [days]\n- Daily review time: [minutes]\n- Target: [what you're optimizing for]\n\n═══════════════════════════════════════════\n\nRETENTION ANALYSIS BY TOPIC\n──────────────────────────────\n\n[Topic 1]: [Retention rate]\n- Card count: [number]\n- Status: [Excellent/Good/At-risk/Needs help]\n- Average interval: [days]\n- Problem cards: [number]\n- Recommendation: [action needed]\n\n[Topic 2]: [Retention rate]\n...\n\n═══════════════════════════════════════════\n\nPROBLEM CARD ANALYSIS\n──────────────────────\n\nFAILING CARDS (lowest retention):\nCard 1: [Card content]\n- Current retention: [%]\n- Review count: [number]\n- Status: Likely concept gap or card design issue\n- Action: [Redesign/deeper study/clearer wording]\n\nCard 2: [Card content]\n...\n\nAT-RISK CARDS (declining retention):\nCard 1: [Card content]\n- Current retention: [%]\n- Trend: [Improving/Stable/Declining]\n- Issue: [What's likely wrong]\n- Action: [Increase frequency/redesign/more study]\n\n...\n\n═══════════════════════════════════════════\n\nINTERVAL OPTIMIZATION\n─────────────────────\n\nRecommended changes:\n- [X cards]: Extend interval to [Y days] (well-mastered, no longer need frequent review)\n- [X cards]: Increase frequency to every [Y days] (at-risk, need more exposure)\n- [X cards]: Return to learning queue (failing, need foundational understanding)\n- [X cards]: Redesign before continuing (poor card design preventing retention)\n\nProjected impact:\n- Daily review time reduction/increase: [minutes]\n- Estimated retention improvement: [percentage points]\n- Time to preparation deadline: [assessment of feasibility]\n\n═══════════════════════════════════════════\n\nCARD DESIGN IMPROVEMENTS\n────────────────────────\n\nCards that need redesign:\nCard 1: [Original]\n- Problem: [What's wrong]\n- Proposed redesign: [Better version]\n- Expected improvement: [Why this should help]\n\nCard 2: [Original]\n...\n\n═══════════════════════════════════════════\n\nCONCEPT MASTERY PRIORITIES\n───────────────────────────\n\nHigh-priority concepts to study deeper:\n1.

[Study [concept] more deeply using [resource]]\n\nCheck-in schedule:\n- [Date]: Review progress and retention rates\n- [Date]: Reassess and adjust plan as needed\n```\n\n## Key Guidelines\n\n- **Data-driven**: Base recommendations on actual retention data, not guesses\n- **Targeted**: Focus effort on highest-impact improvements\n- **Balanced**: Don't over-study what you already know well\n- **Diagnostic**: Identify root causes, not just symptoms\n- **Actionable**: Give specific changes to make, not vague advice\n- **Realistic**: Consider available time and deadlines\n- **Iterative**: Plan for checkpoints and adjustments\n\n## Card Design Red Flags\n\nFailing cards often have issues like:\n- **Too much information**: Card contains 3 concepts, should be 1\n- **Ambiguous wording**: Multiple valid answers to the question\n- **Incomplete answer**: Answer doesn't fully address the question\n- **Concept confusion**: Card tests understanding of a concept you haven't mastered\n- **Poor formulation**: Question doesn't clearly indicate what to recall\n- **Connection gaps**: Card assumes related knowledge you don't have\n\n## Process\n\n1. Ask the user to provide Anki statistics (can be screenshot, export, or summary)\n2. Ask about practice test results and concept confidence\n3. Ask about their study deadline and goals\n4. Ask about daily available study time\n5. Perform analysis using the framework above\n6. Create optimization plan with specific actions\n7. Offer to help redesign problematic cards\n8. Schedule follow-up analysis to track progress\n\n## Integration with Stanner's Methodology\n\nThis skill supports:\n- **Efficient practice**: Focus on weaknesses, not on reviewing what you know\n- **Continuous improvement**: Regular optimization prevents wasted effort\n- **Data-driven study**: Let metrics guide where to focus\n- **Concept mastery**: Identify gaps between what you review and what you understand\n- **Test preparation**: Optimize for success on high-stakes exams\n- **Weakness targeting**: Identify and eliminate problem areas\n"}}],"stop_reason":"tool_use","stop_sequence":null,"usage":{"input_tokens":1,"cache_creation_input_tokens":1150,"cache_read_input_tokens":44075,"cache_creation":{"ephemeral_5m_input_tokens":1150,"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens":0},"output_tokens":10641,"service_tier":"standard"},"context_management":{"applied_edits":[]}},"requestId":"req_011CVZX3SprwHZVznLpgFXmL","type":"assistant","uuid":"138241f7-7a07-4c03-85b5-d243f5fcdb53","timestamp":"2025-11-28T02:45:22.244Z"}

How would you implement encryption and access controls to protect patient data?\"\n- \"Given a company that needs to process sensitive financial data, what security measures would you recommend and why?\"\n\n### Type 3: Connection Questions\nAsk students to connect and relate multiple concepts.\n\nExamples:\n- \"How does multi-factor authentication relate to the principle of defense in depth? What role does it play in an overall security strategy?\"\n- \"Explain the relationship between data classification, encryption requirements, and access controls in a data security policy.\"\n\n### Type 4: Analysis Questions\nAsk students to analyze problems, evaluate solutions, or compare approaches.\n\nExamples:\n- \"Compare role-based access control (RBAC) and attribute-based access control (ABAC). When would you use each approach?\"\n- \"Analyze a security breach scenario and identify which security controls failed and why.\"\n\n### Type 5: \"Why\" and \"How\" Questions\nDig deeper into reasoning and mechanisms.\n\nExamples:\n- \"Why is it important to separate the principle of least privilege from role-based access control?\"\n- \"How does encryption at rest differ from encryption in transit, and why is both necessary?\"\n\n### Type 6: Synthesis Questions\nAsk students to combine multiple concepts to solve complex problems.\n\nExamples:\n- \"Design a comprehensive security architecture for a cloud-based e-commerce platform that handles payment data.\"\n- \"Create an incident response plan that addresses detection, containment, and recovery for a ransomware attack.\"\n\n### Type 7: Troubleshooting Questions\nAsk students to diagnose problems or explain why something doesn't work.\n\nExamples:\n- \"A company implemented all encryption requirements but is still experiencing data breaches. What else might be missing?\"\n- \"Why might a biometric authentication system fail even if the biometric data is perfectly captured?\"\n\n## Guidelines for Question Quality\n\n### ✅ DO:\n- Use clear, specific language that's easy to understand\n- Ask about practical applications and real-world scenarios\n- Require explanations, not just single-word answers\n- Test understanding of \"why\" and \"how\", not just \"what\"\n- Make questions substantial enough to prevent quick answering\n- Include context when relevant\n- Test connections between concepts\n- Ask questions you would ask a colleague or peer\n\n### ❌ DON'T:\n- Create multiple-choice questions (they bypass deep understanding)\n- Ask trivial fact questions (\"What is the definition of X?\")\n- Include the answer in the question\n- Make questions ambiguous or confusing\n- Ask yes/no questions unless testing a specific binary fact\n- Make questions so complex they're unclear\n- Test memorization over understanding\n\n## Output Format\n\nPresent questions in this structure:\n\n```\nQUESTION GENERATION: [TOPIC]\n============================\n\nDIFFICULTY LEVEL: [Beginner/Intermediate/Advanced]\n\n[Question 1]\nCategory: [Explanation/Application/Connection/Analysis/Why-How/Synthesis/Troubleshooting]\nFocus: [What specific concept or skill this tests]\nSample Answer Direction: [Brief hint about what a good answer should include]\n\n[Question 2]\nCategory: [...]\nFocus: [...]\nSample Answer Direction: [...]\n\n[Additional questions as needed]\n\nUSAGE SUGGESTIONS\n- These questions work best for active recall practice\n- Try answering without notes first, then review material\n- Discuss your answers aloud to test explanation ability\n- Use strongest questions for Anki cards\n```\n\n## Process\n\n1.

Use:\n- Simple, everyday words\n- Concrete examples and analogies\n- Comparisons to things kids understand\n- Short sentences\n- Repetition of key ideas\n\n**Example - Encryption:**\n\"Imagine you have a secret message you want to send to your friend. You write it in a special code that only your friend knows how to read. If someone else finds the message, they can't understand it because they don't know the code. That's like encryption—you scramble your information so only the right person can read it.\"\n\n### Level 2: High School Level\n**Purpose**: Use appropriate terminology but explain clearly:\n- Introduce relevant technical terms\n- Explain each term as you use it\n- Use examples that a smart high schooler would understand\n- Show relationships between concepts\n- Keep explanations accessible without oversimplifying\n\n**Example - Encryption:**\n\"Encryption is a process where readable data (plaintext) is converted into unreadable form (ciphertext) using an algorithm and a key. Only someone with the correct key can decrypt the ciphertext back into plaintext. This protects data by making it useless to anyone who doesn't have the key, even if they intercept it.\"\n\n### Level 3: Expert/Technical Level\n**Purpose**: Include nuance, edge cases, and precise language:\n- Use precise technical terminology\n- Discuss implementation details\n- Acknowledge complexity and tradeoffs\n- Reference relevant standards or algorithms\n- Discuss security implications and considerations\n\n**Example - Encryption:**\n\"Encryption employs cryptographic algorithms (symmetric or asymmetric) to transform plaintext into ciphertext. Symmetric encryption (AES, DES) uses a shared secret key for both encryption and decryption, offering high performance but requiring secure key exchange. Asymmetric encryption (RSA, ECC) uses public-private key pairs, enabling secure key exchange but with higher computational cost. Modern security architectures often employ hybrid approaches, using asymmetric encryption for key exchange and symmetric encryption for bulk data protection.\"\n\n## The Testing Process\n\nFor each concept, create all three explanations:\n\n1. **First, write the ELI5 version**\n   - If you struggle here, you don't understand the core concept\n   - Work until it's simple and clear\n\n2. **Then, write the high school version**\n   - This should flow naturally from the ELI5 version\n   - Add terminology and detail\n\n3. **Finally, write the expert version**\n   - Build on the previous level with nuance and precision\n   - Include technical details and considerations\n\n4. **Check for gaps**\n   - If you can't explain at one level, that's where understanding is weak\n   - Go back and study that aspect more\n\n## Output Format\n\n```\nCONCEPT: [Concept name]\n════════════════════════════════════════════\n\nLEVEL 1: EXPLAIN LIKE I'M 5\n───────────────────────────\n[Simple, accessible explanation]\n\nCore analogy or comparison:\n[The key analogy that makes this understandable]\n\nKey insight at this level:\n[What a 5-year-old should understand]\n\n═══════════════════════════════════════════\n\nLEVEL 2: HIGH SCHOOL STUDENT\n──────────────────────────────\n[Clear explanation with appropriate terminology]\n\nKey terms introduced:\n- [Term 1]: [Definition]\n- [Term 2]: [Definition]\n\nReal-world example:\n[Example a high schooler would relate to]\n\nConnection to other concepts:\n[How this relates to other things they know]\n\n═══════════════════════════════════════════\n\nLEVEL 3: EXPERT/TECHNICAL\n──────────────────────────\n[Precise technical explanation]\n\nTechnical considerations:\n- [Consideration 1]\n- [Consideration 2]\n- [Consideration 3]\n\nImplementation details:\n[Specific algorithms, standards, or approaches]\n\nTradeoffs and limitations:\n[Nuance about when and how this is used]\n\nSecurity implications:\n[Relevant security considerations]\n\n═══════════════════════════════════════════\n\nUNDERSTANDING ASSESSMENT\n─────────────────────────\nConfidence level: [Based on difficulty explaining at each level]\n- Level 1 clarity: [Easy/Moderate/Difficult]\n- Level 2 clarity: [Easy/Moderate/Difficult]\n- Level 3 clarity: [Easy/Moderate/Difficult]\n\nIdentified gaps:\n[If any level was difficult, what specifically is unclear?]\n\nNext steps for deepening:\n[Specific areas to study more]\n\n═══════════════════════════════════════════\n\nANKI CARD POTENTIAL\n────────────────────\nBest question formulation:\n[This testing helps formulate better Anki questions]\n\nExplanation-based card:\nQ: [Question requiring explanation at appropriate level]\nA: [Answer that emphasizes understanding]\n```\n\n## Key Guidelines\n\n- **Start with ELI5**: If you can't do this, your understanding isn't deep enough\n- **Use analogies**: Analogies are crucial for simplification\n- **Avoid jargon creep**: Don't accidentally use technical terms in Level 1\n- **Build progressively**: Each level builds on the previous one\n- **Be honest**: If you struggle at a level, note it and study that aspect more\n- **Use examples**: Each level should include concrete examples\n- **Don't oversimplify**: Level 3 should still be accurate and complete\n\n## Process\n\n1.

Are old cards stable?\n- **Card design issues**: Are some cards worded unclearly or too ambiguous?\n- **Concept mastery gaps**: Do related cards show the same weakness?\n\n### Step 3: Categorize Cards\nClassify cards into:\n1. **Mastered**: High retention, long intervals (maybe extend intervals)\n2. **Stable**: Good retention, normal intervals (keep current schedule)\n3. **At-risk**: Declining performance, needs intervention\n4. **Failing**: Low retention despite high review count (needs redesign or more study)\n5. **Unstable**: Inconsistent performance (needs clarification or better cards)\n\n### Step 4: Diagnose Root Causes\nFor problematic cards, determine why:\n- **Card design problem**: Ambiguous wording? Too complex? Test this by redesigning\n- **Concept gap**: Don't understand the material. Need deeper study before card will stick\n- **Simple difficulty**: Just hard to remember. May need more examples or connections\n- **Interference**: Similar cards confusing you. May need clearer differentiation\n- **Timing issue**: Card interval is optimized for a different retention goal\n\n### Step 5: Create Optimization Plan\nDesign a strategy that:\n- Increases review frequency for at-risk cards\n- Extends intervals for well-mastered cards\n- Isolates failing cards for redesign/deeper study\n- Connects related concepts better\n- Balances review load across topics\n- Prioritizes high-value/high-weight topics\n- Allocates study time proportionally to importance and difficulty\n\n## Output Structure\n\n```\nSPACED REPETITION ANALYSIS\n════════════════════════════\n\nOVERVIEW\n────────\nCurrent status:\n- Total cards: [number]\n- Overall retention rate: [percentage]\n- Average review interval: [days]\n- Daily review time: [minutes]\n- Target: [what you're optimizing for]\n\n═══════════════════════════════════════════\n\nRETENTION ANALYSIS BY TOPIC\n──────────────────────────────\n\n[Topic 1]: [Retention rate]\n- Card count: [number]\n- Status: [Excellent/Good/At-risk/Needs help]\n- Average interval: [days]\n- Problem cards: [number]\n- Recommendation: [action needed]\n\n[Topic 2]: [Retention rate]\n...\n\n═══════════════════════════════════════════\n\nPROBLEM CARD ANALYSIS\n──────────────────────\n\nFAILING CARDS (lowest retention):\nCard 1: [Card content]\n- Current retention: [%]\n- Review count: [number]\n- Status: Likely concept gap or card design issue\n- Action: [Redesign/deeper study/clearer wording]\n\nCard 2: [Card content]\n...\n\nAT-RISK CARDS (declining retention):\nCard 1: [Card content]\n- Current retention: [%]\n- Trend: [Improving/Stable/Declining]\n- Issue: [What's likely wrong]\n- Action: [Increase frequency/redesign/more study]\n\n...\n\n═══════════════════════════════════════════\n\nINTERVAL OPTIMIZATION\n─────────────────────\n\nRecommended changes:\n- [X cards]: Extend interval to [Y days] (well-mastered, no longer need frequent review)\n- [X cards]: Increase frequency to every [Y days] (at-risk, need more exposure)\n- [X cards]: Return to learning queue (failing, need foundational understanding)\n- [X cards]: Redesign before continuing (poor card design preventing retention)\n\nProjected impact:\n- Daily review time reduction/increase: [minutes]\n- Estimated retention improvement: [percentage points]\n- Time to preparation deadline: [assessment of feasibility]\n\n═══════════════════════════════════════════\n\nCARD DESIGN IMPROVEMENTS\n────────────────────────\n\nCards that need redesign:\nCard 1: [Original]\n- Problem: [What's wrong]\n- Proposed redesign: [Better version]\n- Expected improvement: [Why this should help]\n\nCard 2: [Original]\n...\n\n═══════════════════════════════════════════\n\nCONCEPT MASTERY PRIORITIES\n───────────────────────────\n\nHigh-priority concepts to study deeper:\n1.

Use:\n- Simple, everyday words\n- Concrete examples and analogies\n- Comparisons to things kids understand\n- Short sentences\n- Repetition of key ideas\n\n**Example - Encryption:**\n\"Imagine you have a secret message you want to send to your friend. You write it in a special code that only your friend knows how to read. If someone else finds the message, they can't understand it because they don't know the code. That's like encryption—you scramble your information so only the right person can read it.\"\n\n### Level 2: High School Level\n**Purpose**: Use appropriate terminology but explain clearly:\n- Introduce relevant technical terms\n- Explain each term as you use it\n- Use examples that a smart high schooler would understand\n- Show relationships between concepts\n- Keep explanations accessible without oversimplifying\n\n**Example - Encryption:**\n\"Encryption is a process where readable data (plaintext) is converted into unreadable form (ciphertext) using an algorithm and a key. Only someone with the correct key can decrypt the ciphertext back into plaintext. This protects data by making it useless to anyone who doesn't have the key, even if they intercept it.\"\n\n### Level 3: Expert/Technical Level\n**Purpose**: Include nuance, edge cases, and precise language:\n- Use precise technical terminology\n- Discuss implementation details\n- Acknowledge complexity and tradeoffs\n- Reference relevant standards or algorithms\n- Discuss security implications and considerations\n\n**Example - Encryption:**\n\"Encryption employs cryptographic algorithms (symmetric or asymmetric) to transform plaintext into ciphertext. Symmetric encryption (AES, DES) uses a shared secret key for both encryption and decryption, offering high performance but requiring secure key exchange. Asymmetric encryption (RSA, ECC) uses public-private key pairs, enabling secure key exchange but with higher computational cost. Modern security architectures often employ hybrid approaches, using asymmetric encryption for key exchange and symmetric encryption for bulk data protection.\"\n\n## The Testing Process\n\nFor each concept, create all three explanations:\n\n1. **First, write the ELI5 version**\n   - If you struggle here, you don't understand the core concept\n   - Work until it's simple and clear\n\n2. **Then, write the high school version**\n   - This should flow naturally from the ELI5 version\n   - Add terminology and detail\n\n3. **Finally, write the expert version**\n   - Build on the previous level with nuance and precision\n   - Include technical details and considerations\n\n4. **Check for gaps**\n   - If you can't explain at one level, that's where understanding is weak\n   - Go back and study that aspect more\n\n## Output Format\n\n```\nCONCEPT: [Concept name]\n════════════════════════════════════════════\n\nLEVEL 1: EXPLAIN LIKE I'M 5\n───────────────────────────\n[Simple, accessible explanation]\n\nCore analogy or comparison:\n[The key analogy that makes this understandable]\n\nKey insight at this level:\n[What a 5-year-old should understand]\n\n═══════════════════════════════════════════\n\nLEVEL 2: HIGH SCHOOL STUDENT\n──────────────────────────────\n[Clear explanation with appropriate terminology]\n\nKey terms introduced:\n- [Term 1]: [Definition]\n- [Term 2]: [Definition]\n\nReal-world example:\n[Example a high schooler would relate to]\n\nConnection to other concepts:\n[How this relates to other things they know]\n\n═══════════════════════════════════════════\n\nLEVEL 3: EXPERT/TECHNICAL\n──────────────────────────\n[Precise technical explanation]\n\nTechnical considerations:\n- [Consideration 1]\n- [Consideration 2]\n- [Consideration 3]\n\nImplementation details:\n[Specific algorithms, standards, or approaches]\n\nTradeoffs and limitations:\n[Nuance about when and how this is used]\n\nSecurity implications:\n[Relevant security considerations]\n\n═══════════════════════════════════════════\n\nUNDERSTANDING ASSESSMENT\n─────────────────────────\nConfidence level: [Based on difficulty explaining at each level]\n- Level 1 clarity: [Easy/Moderate/Difficult]\n- Level 2 clarity: [Easy/Moderate/Difficult]\n- Level 3 clarity: [Easy/Moderate/Difficult]\n\nIdentified gaps:\n[If any level was difficult, what specifically is unclear?]\n\nNext steps for deepening:\n[Specific areas to study more]\n\n═══════════════════════════════════════════\n\nANKI CARD POTENTIAL\n────────────────────\nBest question formulation:\n[This testing helps formulate better Anki questions]\n\nExplanation-based card:\nQ: [Question requiring explanation at appropriate level]\nA: [Answer that emphasizes understanding]\n```\n\n## Key Guidelines\n\n- **Start with ELI5**: If you can't do this, your understanding isn't deep enough\n- **Use analogies**: Analogies are crucial for simplification\n- **Avoid jargon creep**: Don't accidentally use technical terms in Level 1\n- **Build progressively**: Each level builds on the previous one\n- **Be honest**: If you struggle at a level, note it and study that aspect more\n- **Use examples**: Each level should include concrete examples\n- **Don't oversimplify**: Level 3 should still be accurate and complete\n\n## Process\n\n1. Ask what concept or topic they want to test their understanding of\n2. Ask if they want to write the explanations themselves first, or have me help guide them\n3. Help develop all three levels of explanation\n4. Identify where understanding is strongest and weakest\n5. Suggest areas for deeper study based on difficulty\n6. Offer to turn clear explanations into Anki cards\n\n## Integration with Stanner's Methodology\n\nThis skill supports:\n- **Deep understanding**: Forces you to truly grasp concepts\n- **Identifying gaps**: Reveals exactly what you don't understand\n- **Explanation practice**: Develops communication skills\n- **Active learning**: Engaging process, not passive reading\n- **Anki optimization**: Better explanations become better flashcards\n- **Teaching ability**: You'll be able to explain to colleagues and others\n","structuredPatch":[],"originalFile":null}}

Are old cards stable?\n- **Card design issues**: Are some cards worded unclearly or too ambiguous?\n- **Concept mastery gaps**: Do related cards show the same weakness?\n\n### Step 3: Categorize Cards\nClassify cards into:\n1. **Mastered**: High retention, long intervals (maybe extend intervals)\n2. **Stable**: Good retention, normal intervals (keep current schedule)\n3. **At-risk**: Declining performance, needs intervention\n4. **Failing**: Low retention despite high review count (needs redesign or more study)\n5. **Unstable**: Inconsistent performance (needs clarification or better cards)\n\n### Step 4: Diagnose Root Causes\nFor problematic cards, determine why:\n- **Card design problem**: Ambiguous wording? Too complex? Test this by redesigning\n- **Concept gap**: Don't understand the material. Need deeper study before card will stick\n- **Simple difficulty**: Just hard to remember. May need more examples or connections\n- **Interference**: Similar cards confusing you. May need clearer differentiation\n- **Timing issue**: Card interval is optimized for a different retention goal\n\n### Step 5: Create Optimization Plan\nDesign a strategy that:\n- Increases review frequency for at-risk cards\n- Extends intervals for well-mastered cards\n- Isolates failing cards for redesign/deeper study\n- Connects related concepts better\n- Balances review load across topics\n- Prioritizes high-value/high-weight topics\n- Allocates study time proportionally to importance and difficulty\n\n## Output Structure\n\n```\nSPACED REPETITION ANALYSIS\n════════════════════════════\n\nOVERVIEW\n────────\nCurrent status:\n- Total cards: [number]\n- Overall retention rate: [percentage]\n- Average review interval: [days]\n- Daily review time: [minutes]\n- Target: [what you're optimizing for]\n\n═══════════════════════════════════════════\n\nRETENTION ANALYSIS BY TOPIC\n──────────────────────────────\n\n[Topic 1]: [Retention rate]\n- Card count: [number]\n- Status: [Excellent/Good/At-risk/Needs help]\n- Average interval: [days]\n- Problem cards: [number]\n- Recommendation: [action needed]\n\n[Topic 2]: [Retention rate]\n...\n\n═══════════════════════════════════════════\n\nPROBLEM CARD ANALYSIS\n──────────────────────\n\nFAILING CARDS (lowest retention):\nCard 1: [Card content]\n- Current retention: [%]\n- Review count: [number]\n- Status: Likely concept gap or card design issue\n- Action: [Redesign/deeper study/clearer wording]\n\nCard 2: [Card content]\n...\n\nAT-RISK CARDS (declining retention):\nCard 1: [Card content]\n- Current retention: [%]\n- Trend: [Improving/Stable/Declining]\n- Issue: [What's likely wrong]\n- Action: [Increase frequency/redesign/more study]\n\n...\n\n═══════════════════════════════════════════\n\nINTERVAL OPTIMIZATION\n─────────────────────\n\nRecommended changes:\n- [X cards]: Extend interval to [Y days] (well-mastered, no longer need frequent review)\n- [X cards]: Increase frequency to every [Y days] (at-risk, need more exposure)\n- [X cards]: Return to learning queue (failing, need foundational understanding)\n- [X cards]: Redesign before continuing (poor card design preventing retention)\n\nProjected impact:\n- Daily review time reduction/increase: [minutes]\n- Estimated retention improvement: [percentage points]\n- Time to preparation deadline: [assessment of feasibility]\n\n═══════════════════════════════════════════\n\nCARD DESIGN IMPROVEMENTS\n────────────────────────\n\nCards that need redesign:\nCard 1: [Original]\n- Problem: [What's wrong]\n- Proposed redesign: [Better version]\n- Expected improvement: [Why this should help]\n\nCard 2: [Original]\n...\n\n═══════════════════════════════════════════\n\nCONCEPT MASTERY PRIORITIES\n───────────────────────────\n\nHigh-priority concepts to study deeper:\n1.

Key elements:\n\n### Anki Flashcard Strategy\n- **Explanation-based cards**: Format cards to test ability to explain concepts in your own words, not just recall answers\n- **Avoid premature answers**: Prevent answering before finishing the question by using longer, more contextual prompts\n- **No multiple-choice**: Exclude multiple-choice questions—they bypass deep understanding\n- **Visual enhancement**: Add diagrams, pictures, and visual aids to reinforce concepts\n- **Spaced practice**: Regular review to maintain connections between related topics\n\n### Deep Understanding Process\n1. **Lecture Processing**: Extract main concepts, list key points, analyze provided examples\n2. **Active Recall During Reading**: Summarize paragraphs before checking answers, explain concepts from memory\n3. **Page-by-Page Questions**: Generate end-of-page comprehension and application questions\n4. **Subject Completion**: Identify confident areas and topics needing review upon completion\n5. **Spider Diagrams**: Create mind maps showing conceptual connections, convert to Anki cards, regularly review\n\n### Assessment & Refinement\n- **Practice Tests**: Take frequent practice tests, analyze both correct and incorrect answers\n- **Weakness Focus**: Identify and revisit challenging areas repeatedly\n- **Practical Application**: Create labs, projects, and real-world scenario exercises\n- **Continuous Improvement**: Regularly reassess and adjust methods based on effectiveness\n\n### Mindset & Philosophy\n- **Craftsperson Mindset**: Build rare, valuable skills with dedication—don't chase passion, fall in love with the journey\n- **Simplification Test**: Verify deep understanding by explaining topics simply (like to a 5-year-old)\n- **Avoid Surface Learning**: Don't rely on summarization and re-reading; engage actively with material\n- **Question Quality**: Learn to write and ask good questions—this develops deeper understanding\n- **Wrestling with Ideas**: Seek underlying principles, don't settle for surface-level information\n\n### Study Environment & Structure\n- **Dedicated Space**: Study outside your regular environment to maintain focus\n- **Multi-modal Learning**: Combine lectures, reading, mind maps, flashcards, and practical exercises\n- **Weekly Reflection**: Blog about learning progress, insights gained, and challenges faced\n- **Weakness Testing**: Test yourself frequently on difficult material, not on areas you already know\n\n## FLASHCARD OUTPUT GUIDANCE (STANNER'S APPROACH)\n\nWhen creating Anki cards for Stanner:\n\n1. **EXPLANATION PROMPTS**: Design questions that require explaining the concept, not just stating a fact\n   - ❌ Bad: \"Q: What is encryption? A: Process of converting plaintext to ciphertext\"\n   - ✅ Good: \"Q: Explain how encryption protects data and what the relationship is between plaintext, ciphertext, and keys. A: Encryption converts readable data (plaintext) into unreadable form (ciphertext) using a key. Without the correct key, an attacker cannot understand the data even if they access it.\"\n\n2. **CONTEXTUAL PROMPTS**: Use longer, more contextual questions to prevent answering before reading the full prompt\n\n3. **APPLICATION-FOCUSED**: Include \"how\" and \"why\" questions that test understanding of practical applications\n\n4. **CONCEPT CONNECTIONS**: When relevant, ask about relationships between concepts and broader contexts\n\n5. **NO TRIVIAL FACTS**: Avoid single-word-answer cards; focus on concepts requiring explanation\n","numLines":155,"startLine":1,"totalLines":155}}}

Key elements:\n\n### Anki Flashcard Strategy\n- **Explanation-based cards**: Format cards to test ability to explain concepts in your own words, not just recall answers\n- **Avoid premature answers**: Prevent answering before finishing the question by using longer, more contextual prompts\n- **No multiple-choice**: Exclude multiple-choice questions—they bypass deep understanding\n- **Visual enhancement**: Add diagrams, pictures, and visual aids to reinforce concepts\n- **Spaced practice**: Regular review to maintain connections between related topics\n\n### Deep Understanding Process\n1. **Lecture Processing**: Extract main concepts, list key points, analyze provided examples\n2. **Active Recall During Reading**: Summarize paragraphs before checking answers, explain concepts from memory\n3. **Page-by-Page Questions**: Generate end-of-page comprehension and application questions\n4. **Subject Completion**: Identify confident areas and topics needing review upon completion\n5. **Spider Diagrams**: Create mind maps showing conceptual connections, convert to Anki cards, regularly review\n\n### Assessment & Refinement\n- **Practice Tests**: Take frequent practice tests, analyze both correct and incorrect answers\n- **Weakness Focus**: Identify and revisit challenging areas repeatedly\n- **Practical Application**: Create labs, projects, and real-world scenario exercises\n- **Continuous Improvement**: Regularly reassess and adjust methods based on effectiveness\n\n### Mindset & Philosophy\n- **Craftsperson Mindset**: Build rare, valuable skills with dedication—don't chase passion, fall in love with the journey\n- **Simplification Test**: Verify deep understanding by explaining topics simply (like to a 5-year-old)\n- **Avoid Surface Learning**: Don't rely on summarization and re-reading; engage actively with material\n- **Question Quality**: Learn to write and ask good questions—this develops deeper understanding\n- **Wrestling with Ideas**: Seek underlying principles, don't settle for surface-level information\n\n### Study Environment & Structure\n- **Dedicated Space**: Study outside your regular environment to maintain focus\n- **Multi-modal Learning**: Combine lectures, reading, mind maps, flashcards, and practical exercises\n- **Weekly Reflection**: Blog about learning progress, insights gained, and challenges faced\n- **Weakness Testing**: Test yourself frequently on difficult material, not on areas you already know\n\n## FLASHCARD OUTPUT GUIDANCE (STANNER'S APPROACH)\n\nWhen creating Anki cards for Stanner:\n\n1. **EXPLANATION PROMPTS**: Design questions that require explaining the concept, not just stating a fact\n   - ❌ Bad: \"Q: What is encryption? A: Process of converting plaintext to ciphertext\"\n   - ✅ Good: \"Q: Explain how encryption protects data and what the relationship is between plaintext, ciphertext, and keys. A: Encryption converts readable data (plaintext) into unreadable form (ciphertext) using a key. Without the correct key, an attacker cannot understand the data even if they access it.\"\n\n2. **CONTEXTUAL PROMPTS**: Use longer, more contextual questions to prevent answering before reading the full prompt\n\n3. **APPLICATION-FOCUSED**: Include \"how\" and \"why\" questions that test understanding of practical applications\n\n4. **CONCEPT CONNECTIONS**: When relevant, ask about relationships between concepts and broader contexts\n\n5. **NO TRIVIAL FACTS**: Avoid single-word-answer cards; focus on concepts requiring explanation\n","structuredPatch":[{"oldStart":137,"oldLines":6,"newStart":137,"newLines":52,"lines":[" - **Weekly Reflection**: Blog about learning progress, insights gained, and challenges faced"," - **Weakness Testing**: Test yourself frequently on difficult material, not on areas you already know"," ","+## SPECIALIZED SKILLS AVAILABLE","+","+In addition to the core operating modes, you have access to 7 specialized learning skills that deepen your study effectiveness:","+","+### 1.
