Now I have comprehensive information. Let me provide you with a complete guide:\n\n## When to Run Claude from a Specific Project Directory vs. Home Directory\n\nBased on the official Claude Code documentation, here's the practical guidance:\n\n### 1. **When to Establish a Project Directory (cd into your project)**\n\nYou should cd into a specific project directory when:\n\n- **Working on an actual codebase**: You're developing, debugging, or modifying code within a repository. This ensures Claude Code can discover and use project-specific context.\n\n- **You need project-specific configuration**: Your project requires custom permissions, environment variables, or settings stored in `.claude/settings.json` or `.claude/settings.local.json`.\n\n- **You're using project memory (CLAUDE.md)**: If your project or team has established documentation via CLAUDE.md files, you need to be in the project directory (or a subdirectory of it) for Claude to discover and load this context.\n\n- **You're using custom slash commands or agents**: If your team has defined project-specific commands in `.claude/commands/` or agents in `.claude/agents/`, you need to be in the project directory for these to be available.\n\n- **You're collaborating with a team**: Project-level configuration is shared with teammates via source control, ensuring consistent workflows.\n\n**Example scenarios:**\n- You're fixing a bug in a web application at `/home/user/projects/my-webapp`\n- You're building a feature in a monorepo at `/home/user/monorepo/services/api`\n- You're working on a shared codebase where the team has set up project memory and custom commands\n\n### 2. **When It's Okay to Run from Home Directory or Elsewhere**\n\nYou can run Claude from your home directory or arbitrary locations when:\n\n- **Quick, one-off tasks**: You're doing a simple script, learning a concept, or experimenting with something that doesn't relate to a specific project.\n\n- **Using global settings only**: You only need the universal settings from `~/.claude/settings.json` that apply across all projects.\n\n- **Cross-project analysis**: You're analyzing code patterns across multiple projects and don't need project-specific context.\n\n- **General assistance**: You're asking Claude for help that isn't tied to a particular codebase (e.g., explaining concepts, writing documentation).\n\n**Example scenarios:**\n- You're writing a quick Python script for personal use\n- You're learning how to use a new library without a specific project\n- You're getting general programming advice\n- You're testing Claude Code features\n\n### 3. **Best Practices for Organizing Work with Claude Code**\n\n**Project Root Navigation:**\nAlways navigate to your project root directory before starting a Claude Code session. This ensures Claude discovers all relevant context files recursively as it walks up the directory tree.\n\n**Memory File Discovery:**\nClaude Code searches for CLAUDE.md or CLAUDE.local.md files starting in your current working directory and recursing up to (but not including) the root filesystem. Example directory structure:\n\n```\n/home/user/monorepo/\n├── CLAUDE.md                    (discovered from monorepo level)\n├── services/\n│   ├── api/\n│   │   ├── CLAUDE.md            (discovered from api directory)\n│   │   └── src/\n│   │       └── (your code)\n│   └── web/\n│       └── (your code)\n```\n\nIf you're working in `/home/user/monorepo/services/api/src`, Claude will load both the monorepo-level and api-level CLAUDE.md files.\n\n**Configuration Organization:**\n```\nyour-project/\n├── .claude/\n│   ├── settings.json            (team-shared project settings)\n│   ├── settings.local.json       (your personal project settings)\n│   ├── commands/                 (custom slash commands)\n│   └── agents/                   (custom agents)\n├── CLAUDE.md                     (project memory/documentation)\n└── (your code)\n```\n\n**Parallel Work with Git Worktrees:**\nUse Git worktrees for simultaneous tasks on different branches:\n```bash\ngit worktree add ../my-project-feature-x branch-name\n```\nEach worktree has its own independent file state, perfect for parallel Claude Code sessions without interference.\n\n### 4. **Implications of Running from Different Directories**\n\n**Project Directory (cd into your project):**\n- All project-specific settings, commands, agents, and memory are available\n- Claude has full context about your codebase structure\n- Permissions and environment variables are properly scoped\n- File references are resolved relative to the project root\n- Better for focused, context-aware work\n\n**Subdirectory within a project (e.g., `project/src/components/`):**\n- Claude still discovers project memory and settings by walking up to the project root\n- Terminal commands run from that subdirectory (though Claude Code resets the working directory between bash calls by default)\n- May limit Claude's automatic file context discovery\n- Less ideal than starting from project root\n\n**Home directory or unrelated locations:**\n- No project-specific context is loaded\n- Only global settings from `~/.claude/settings.json` apply\n- No custom commands or agents specific to any project\n- Better for standalone work unrelated to specific projects\n\n### 5. **How Claude Code Behavior Changes Based on Working Directory**\n\n**File Context Discovery:**\nWhen you provide files to Claude, the directory structure matters. Starting from the project root ensures Claude understands the full project architecture and can make better decisions about file relationships.\n\n**Bash Command Execution:**\nClaude Code has a mechanism (`CLAUDE_BASH_MAINTAIN_PROJECT_WORKING_DIR`) that returns to the original working directory after bash commands. This prevents accidental directory changes from affecting subsequent commands.\n\n**Memory Hierarchy:**\nProject-level memories (CLAUDE.md) take precedence over user-level and enterprise-level memories. Working from the correct project directory ensures the right memory files are loaded.\n\n**Permission Scoping:**\nPermissions defined in `.claude/settings.json` at your project root apply to that project. Working from the project directory ensures these security controls are active.\n\n## Quick Decision Tree\n\n```\nAre you working on a specific codebase?\n├─ Yes → cd into the project directory (ideally at root)\n└─ No → Safe to run from home directory or elsewhere\n\nDoes your project have custom setup (.claude/ directory)?\n├─ Yes → Must cd into the project directory\n└─ No → Running from anywhere still works, but project root is recommended\n\nIs this a standalone, one-off task?\n├─ Yes → Home directory is fine\n└─ No → Use the appropriate project directory\n```\n\n## Practical Examples\n\n**Scenario 1: Web Development**\n```bash\ncd /home/user/projects/my-webapp    # Navigate to project\nclaude                               # Start Claude Code with full context\n```\n\n**Scenario 2: Quick Script**\n```bash\ncd ~                                 # Stay in home directory\nclaude                               # Start Claude for a quick task\n```\n\n**Scenario 3: Monorepo Work**\n```bash\ncd /home/user/monorepo               # Start at monorepo root (or service root)\nclaude                               # Discovers all relevant CLAUDE.md files\n```\n\n**Scenario 4: Multiple Parallel Work**\n```bash\n# Main branch work\ncd /home/user/my-project && claude\n\n# Parallel work on feature branch\ncd /home/user/my-project-feature-x && claude   # Using git worktree\n```\n\nThe key takeaway: **Always cd into your project directory for actual project work** to ensure Claude has access to project-specific context, settings, and configurations. Use home directory or arbitrary locations only for standalone tasks unrelated to specific codebases."}],"stop_reason":null,"stop_sequence":null,"usage":{"input_tokens":6,"cache_creation_input_tokens":1384,"cache_read_input_tokens":4940,"cache_creation":{"ephemeral_5m_input_tokens":1384,"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens":0},"output_tokens":4,"service_tier":"standard"}},"requestId":"req_011CVXN2nRFJyzpvt4JJYNfk","type":"assistant","uuid":"d94734b8-1a27-462a-9615-d41aec12ea57","timestamp":"2025-11-26T23:24:43.308Z"}
