Tools WITH Existing MCP Wrappers\n\n**Covered:**\n- Volatility 3 (memory forensics)\n- VirusTotal (malware/threat intelligence)\n- Velociraptor (endpoint DFIR)\n- Wazuh/Panther (SIEM)\n- Nmap, Masscan (network scanning)\n- Basic file integrity tools (hashing, metadata)\n- YARA (via memory forensics integrations)\n\n---\n\n## 3. Tools NEEDING Custom MCP Development\n\n**Eric Zimmerman Tools (CRITICAL GAP):**\n- RECmd (Registry analysis)\n- MFTECmd (MFT parsing)\n- EvtxECmd (Windows Event Log parsing)\n- PECmd (Prefetch analysis)\n- JLECmd (Jump List analysis)\n- LECmd (LNK file analysis)\n- SBECmd (ShellBags analysis)\n\n**Other Missing Tools:**\n- **Chainsaw** (Windows event log analysis and threat hunting)\n- **KAPE** (Forensic artifact collection)\n- **Plaso/Log2Timeline** (Timeline analysis)\n- **Autopsy** (Digital forensics platform)\n- **FTK Imager** (Forensic imaging)\n- **Sleuth Kit** (File system analysis)\n- **Regripper** (Registry analysis)\n- **Bulk Extractor** (Feature extraction)\n\n---\n\n## 4. Recommendations for Implementation\n\n### **Priority 1: High-Impact ERIC Tools**\nThese are essential for Windows forensics and currently have NO MCP wrappers:\n\n1. **EvtxECmd** - Windows Event Log parsing is critical for incident response\n   - Standardized CSV/JSON output makes it ideal for MCP integration\n   - Most frequently used ERIC tool in IR scenarios\n\n2. **RECmd** - Registry analysis for persistence mechanisms\n   - Essential for malware and intrusion analysis\n   - Can process registry hives from thousands of machines\n\n3. **MFTECmd** - NTFS Master File Table analysis\n   - Timeline reconstruction and file access patterns\n   - Critical for forensic investigations\n\n### **Priority 2: Log Analysis and Threat Hunting**\n4. **Chainsaw** - Windows event log threat hunting\n   - Sigma rule support\n   - Built-in threat detection logic\n   - No current MCP implementation found\n\n5. **Enhanced Log Analysis MCP** - Extend current forensic toolkit\n   - Windows event log correlation\n   - Timeline analysis capabilities\n   - Integration with existing SIEM MCP servers\n\n### **Priority 3: Unified ERIC Tools Suite**\n6. **Complete ERIC Tools MCP Server** - All-in-one wrapper\n   - Single server exposing all ERIC tools\n   - Standardized output formats (JSON/CSV)\n   - Batch processing capabilities\n   - Could be modeled after the Volatility MCP implementation\n\n### **Why These Recommendations:**\n\n**For CDSA Blue Team Work:**\n- Windows event logs (EvtxECmd) are the primary data source for incident detection\n- Registry analysis (RECmd) reveals persistence and malware behavior\n- MFT analysis (MFTECmd) provides filesystem timeline reconstruction\n- Chainsaw adds automated threat hunting capabilities\n\n**Technical Feasibility:**\n- ERIC tools are .NET-based with consistent CLI interfaces\n- They output standardized formats (CSV, JSON) ideal for MCP\n- Can run on Linux via .NET Core (already proven)\n- Well-documented and actively maintained\n\n**Gap Analysis:**\n- The MCP ecosystem has good coverage for network security (Nmap, etc.)\n- SIEM integration exists (Wazuh, Panther)\n- Memory forensics is covered (Volatility)\n- **Windows artifact forensics is the major gap** - no ERIC tools coverage\n\n**Implementation Strategy:**\nStart with a single ERIC tool (EvtxECmd) as a proof-of-concept, then expand to a comprehensive suite. The Volatility MCP server implementations provide an excellent reference architecture.\n\n---\n\n## Sources\n\n### Forensics MCP Servers:\n- [MCP Forensic Toolkit](https://github.com/axdithyaxo/mcp-forensic-toolkit)\n- [Volatility MCP Server](https://github.com/bornpresident/Volatility-MCP-Server)\n- [Velociraptor MCP Server](https://github.com/socfortress/velociraptor-mcp-server)\n- [MCP for Security Collection](https://github.com/cyproxio/mcp-for-security)\n\n### SIEM and Log Analysis:\n- [Wazuh MCP Server](https://github.com/gbrigandi/mcp-server-wazuh)\n- [Panther MCP Blog](https://panther.com/blog/how-model-context-protocol-helps-security-teams-scale-secops)\n- [MCP and Security Operations](https://www.detectionatscale.com/p/mcp-and-security-operations)\n\n### Threat Intelligence and Malware Analysis:\n- [VirusTotal MCP Server](https://github.com/BurtTheCoder/mcp-virustotal)\n- [Threat.Zone MCP Server](https://github.com/threat-zone/threatzonemcp)\n- [TriageMCP Malware Analysis](https://skywork.ai/skypage/en/triagemcp-ai-malware-analysis/1979016576160276480)\n\n### Community Resources:\n- [Awesome MCP Security](https://github.com/Puliczek/awesome-mcp-security)\n- [Awesome MCP Servers](https://github.com/punkpeye/awesome-mcp-servers)\n- [MCP Forensics Research Paper](https://arxiv.org/html/2506.00274v1)\n\n### ERIC Tools:\n- [Eric Zimmerman's Tools](https://ericzimmerman.github.io/)\n- [EvtxECmd Overview](https://www.sans.org/tools/evtxecmd)\n- [SANS EZ Tools Guide](https://www.sans.org/blog/want-fast-dfir-results-learn-how-with-the-ez-tools-command-line-poster)"}],"stop_reason":null,"stop_sequence":null,"usage":{"input_tokens":1809,"cache_creation_input_tokens":2156,"cache_read_input_tokens":29175,"cache_creation":{"ephemeral_5m_input_tokens":2156,"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens":0},"output_tokens":1,"service_tier":"standard"}},"requestId":"req_011CVXoHrfoo9t7VHtZpQ6Cp","type":"assistant","uuid":"b1c7c4dc-dded-40de-a222-9d4655f32b00","timestamp":"2025-11-27T04:56:28.909Z"}
