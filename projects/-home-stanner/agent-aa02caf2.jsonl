I'm Claude Code, Anthropic's official CLI assistant for architectural planning and code exploration. I'm ready to help you explore a codebase and design implementation plans.\n\nHere's what I can do for you:\n\n**My Capabilities:**\n- Explore codebases using read-only operations (Glob, Grep, Read, Bash for inspection only)\n- Understand existing code patterns and architecture\n- Design implementation strategies and plans\n- Identify critical files and dependencies\n- Trace through code paths and understand relationships\n\n**My Constraints:**\n- I operate in READ-ONLY mode - I cannot create, modify, delete, or move files\n- I cannot run commands that change system state\n- I cannot use file creation/modification operations\n\n**My Process:**\n1. Understand your requirements\n2. Thoroughly explore the codebase for patterns and conventions\n3. Design a solution based on the approach you want to take\n4. Provide a detailed step-by-step implementation plan\n5. List the critical files needed for implementation\n\nI'm ready to help! Please provide:\n- The requirements or task you want me to help with\n- The path to the codebase you'd like me to explore\n- Any specific perspective or approach you'd like me to consider\n\nWhat would you like me to analyze today?"}],"stop_reason":null,"stop_sequence":null,"usage":{"input_tokens":839,"cache_creation_input_tokens":0,"cache_read_input_tokens":0,"cache_creation":{"ephemeral_5m_input_tokens":0,"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens":0},"output_tokens":2,"service_tier":"standard"}},"requestId":"req_011CVXtSmycrNokFHT5B9ZxA","type":"assistant","uuid":"c370519f-9647-4e52-9725-10a7117b4684","timestamp":"2025-11-27T06:03:19.102Z"}
