Analytics (ANxxxx) are specific behavioral or telemetry-based analytic implementations that make detections actionable.\n\n## Scope of Updates\n\nThe Enterprise domain now includes 691 Detection Strategies and 1,739 Analytics, the Mobile domain has 124 Detection Strategies with 211 Analytics, and the ICS domain features 83 Detection Strategies and 82 Analytics.\n\n## Strategic Significance\n\nThe detection strategies serve as a \"behavioral-first blueprint that defines what the adversary behavior is, and why it matters\" to help organizations better mitigate cyber threats. The text in ATT&CK's previous Detections often packed too many behaviors into a single block of text, making them hard to interpret or apply, and important platform differences were sometimes lost.\n\nThe 2025 framework represents a significant evolution toward more structured, actionable threat detection guidance across all three ATT&CK domains (Enterprise, Mobile, and ICS)."],"durationSeconds":8.38074996600009}}
