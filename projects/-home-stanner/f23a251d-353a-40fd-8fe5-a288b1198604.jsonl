You can use which uvx to find and paste the full path in above config in such cases.\n\nCreate a .env file in the working directory with the following required variables:\nOBSIDIAN_API_KEY=your_api_key_here\nOBSIDIAN_HOST=your_obsidian_host\nOBSIDIAN_PORT=your_obsidian_port\nNote:\n\nYou can find the API key in the Obsidian plugin config\nDefault port is 27124 if not specified\nDefault host is 127.0.0.1 if not specified\nQuickstart\nInstall\nObsidian REST API\nYou need the Obsidian REST API community plugin running: https://github.com/coddingtonbear/obsidian-local-rest-api\n\nInstall and enable it in the settings and copy the api key.\n\nClaude Desktop\nOn MacOS: ~/Library/Application\\ Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json\n\nOn Windows: %APPDATA%/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json\n\nDevelopment/Unpublished Servers Configuration\nPublished Servers Configuration\nDevelopment\nBuilding\nTo prepare the package for distribution:\n\nSync dependencies and update lockfile:\nuv sync\nDebugging\nSince MCP servers run over stdio, debugging can be challenging.

Let me break down the steps:\n\n## Setup Steps\n\n1. **Install the Obsidian REST API Plugin**\n   - In Obsidian, go to Settings → Community plugins → Browse\n   - Search for \"Local REST API\" by coddingtonbear\n   - Install and enable it\n   - Copy your API key from the plugin settings\n\n2. **Configure Claude Desktop**\n   \n   Find your Claude config file:\n   - **MacOS**: `~/Library/Application\\ Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json`\n   - **Windows**: `%APPDATA%/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json`\n\n   Add this to your config:\n   ```json\n   {\n     \"mcp-obsidian\": {\n       \"command\": \"uvx\",\n       \"args\": [\"mcp-obsidian\"],\n       \"env\": {\n         \"OBSIDIAN_API_KEY\": \"<your_api_key_from_plugin>\",\n         \"OBSIDIAN_HOST\": \"127.0.0.1\",\n         \"OBSIDIAN_PORT\": \"27124\"\n       }\n     }\n   }\n   ```\n\n3. **Available Tools**\n   Once configured, you'll have access to:\n   - `list_files_in_vault` - List all files in your vault\n   - `list_files_in_dir` - List files in a specific directory\n   - `get_file_contents` - Read file contents\n   - `search` - Search across your vault\n   - `patch_content` - Insert content relative to headings/references\n   - `append_content` - Append to files\n   - `delete_file` - Delete files or directories\n\n4. **Usage Tips**\n   - Start by instructing Claude to use Obsidian\n   - Example: \"Get the contents of the last architecture call note and summarize them\"\n   - The MCP Inspector can help with debugging: `npx @modelcontextprotocol/inspector uv --directory /path/to/mcp-obsidian run mcp-obsidian`\n\nThat's it! After restarting Claude Desktop, the Obsidian MCP server will be available."}],"stop_reason":null,"stop_sequence":null,"usage":{"input_tokens":1,"cache_creation_input_tokens":1845,"cache_read_input_tokens":27900,"cache_creation":{"ephemeral_5m_input_tokens":1845,"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens":0},"output_tokens":1,"service_tier":"standard"}},"requestId":"req_011CVXUpUgNijkcx5PMYBu3m","type":"assistant","uuid":"aaa6d152-d823-48e9-875f-3b6d8bcec42f","timestamp":"2025-11-27T00:53:31.151Z"}
