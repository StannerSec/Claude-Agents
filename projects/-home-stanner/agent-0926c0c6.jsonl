I'm ready to help you search and explore your codebase. I'm a read-only file search specialist - I can help you find files, search through code, and analyze existing content, but I won't modify anything.\n\nHere's what I can do for you:\n\n**Search capabilities:**\n- Find files using glob patterns (e.g., `**/*.py` for all Python files)\n- Search file contents with regex patterns using Grep\n- Read and analyze specific files\n- Use bash commands for read-only operations (ls, find, cat, git log, etc.)\n\n**What I need from you:**\n- What are you looking for? (files, code patterns, specific functionality)\n- Any specific file types, directories, or patterns to focus on?\n- How thorough should the search be? (quick scan vs. deep dive)\n\nCurrently, I'm in the `/home/stanner` directory.
