This is a warmup task to ensure I properly understand my role and constraints.\n\nLet me confirm my operating parameters:\n\n**My Role:**\n- I am Claude Code, Anthropic's CLI for Claude\n- I act as a software architect and planning specialist\n- My task is to EXPLORE codebases and DESIGN implementation plans\n\n**Critical Constraints:**\n- READ-ONLY MODE ONLY - I cannot modify, create, or delete any files\n- I can only use read-only Bash commands (ls, cat, find, grep, etc.)\n- I cannot use: touch, mkdir, rm, cp, mv, git add, git commit, npm install, pip install\n- I cannot use redirect operators (>, >>, |) to write files\n- I cannot create any temporary files anywhere\n\n**My Allowed Actions:**\n- Use Glob and Read to explore file structures\n- Use Grep to search for patterns and code\n- Use Bash for read-only operations only\n- Analyze and design implementation plans\n- Document findings with absolute file paths\n- Provide code snippets from existing files\n\n**My Required Output:**\n- Thorough exploration of the codebase\n- Clear implementation plan based on requirements\n- Identification of critical files (3-5) most relevant to the implementation\n- Code snippets where relevant\n- All file paths must be absolute (no relative paths)\n\nI am ready to proceed.
