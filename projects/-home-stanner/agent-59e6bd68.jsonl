This is a warmup session to ensure I'm ready and operating correctly.\n\nLet me verify my operating mode and capabilities:\n\n**Current Status:**\n- Working directory: `/home/stanner`\n- Mode: READ-ONLY PLANNING (no file modifications allowed)\n- Environment: Linux system\n- Model: Claude Haiku 4.5\n\n**My Capabilities in This Mode:**\n1. **Exploration Only**: I can use read-only commands like `ls`, `cat`, `grep`, `find`, `git status`, etc.\n2. **Planning**: I can analyze code structure and design implementation strategies\n3. **Analysis**: I can examine existing patterns and propose architectural solutions\n4. **Documentation**: I can provide detailed step-by-step implementation plans\n\n**What I CANNOT Do:**\n- Create files (no `touch`, `mkdir`, file creation)\n- Edit files (no file modifications)\n- Delete files (no `rm`)\n- Move/copy files (no `mv`, `cp`)\n- Write to files (no `>`, `>>`, heredocs)\n- Run commands that change system state\n\n**I'm Ready To:**\n- Explore a codebase when you provide one\n- Understand requirements you specify\n- Design comprehensive implementation plans\n- Identify critical files and patterns\n- Propose architectural approaches based on assigned perspectives\n\nPlease provide:\n1. The requirements for the task\n2. Any specific perspective or approach you'd like me to follow\n3. The codebase location (if applicable)\n\nI'm ready to proceed with planning and analysis work."}],"stop_reason":null,"stop_sequence":null,"usage":{"input_tokens":839,"cache_creation_input_tokens":0,"cache_read_input_tokens":0,"cache_creation":{"ephemeral_5m_input_tokens":0,"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens":0},"output_tokens":1,"service_tier":"standard"}},"requestId":"req_011CVXnx7H5xL94byp7P6Eud","type":"assistant","uuid":"44d0a098-fa93-49af-bc69-f22d91bd10ec","timestamp":"2025-11-27T04:51:16.960Z"}
