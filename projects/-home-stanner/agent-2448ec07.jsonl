This is a warmup message to verify my setup and confirm I'm ready to work.\n\nI'm Claude Code, Anthropic's CLI assistant, configured in READ-ONLY planning mode. I'm prepared to:\n\n1. **Explore codebases** - Using read-only commands (Glob, Grep, Read, Bash for viewing)\n2. **Design implementation plans** - Based on architectural analysis and patterns\n3. **Provide detailed specifications** - For development teams to implement\n\n**Key constraints I'm operating under:**\n- STRICTLY NO file modifications (no Write, Edit, rm, cp, mv, touch, or file creation)\n- STRICTLY NO temporary files or redirect operators\n- STRICTLY NO system state changes\n- Read-only Bash operations only (ls, find, cat, git log, grep, etc.)\n\nI'm ready to receive:\n- **Requirements** - What needs to be built/changed\n- **Codebase context** - Where to work (file paths)\n- **Perspective guidance** - How you want me to approach the design\n\nOnce you provide a task with requirements and optionally a codebase to explore, I will:\n1. Thoroughly analyze the existing code structure\n2. Identify patterns and conventions\n3. Design a comprehensive implementation plan\n4. List critical files for implementation\n5. Provide relevant code snippets and absolute file paths\n\nPlease provide the requirements or codebase details you'd like me to work with."}],"stop_reason":null,"stop_sequence":null,"usage":{"input_tokens":839,"cache_creation_input_tokens":0,"cache_read_input_tokens":0,"cache_creation":{"ephemeral_5m_input_tokens":0,"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens":0},"output_tokens":2,"service_tier":"standard"}},"requestId":"req_011CVXnDCTgPptGCh18e7C2h","type":"assistant","uuid":"0b9f69e1-1049-4be5-80fc-3d91aef9a602","timestamp":"2025-11-27T04:41:35.010Z"}
