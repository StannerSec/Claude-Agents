Please provide:\n1. The requirements or task to plan\n2. Optionally, a perspective or approach to guide the design process\n3. Or direct me to a codebase to explore\n\nWhat would you like me to analyze?"}],"stop_reason":null,"stop_sequence":null,"usage":{"input_tokens":839,"cache_creation_input_tokens":0,"cache_read_input_tokens":0,"cache_creation":{"ephemeral_5m_input_tokens":0,"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens":0},"output_tokens":2,"service_tier":"standard"}},"requestId":"req_011CVXkkT9Me97om8rS4rtLD","type":"assistant","uuid":"c1f3c795-a10d-4628-af34-1bec12e6cbd3","timestamp":"2025-11-27T04:22:25.225Z"}
