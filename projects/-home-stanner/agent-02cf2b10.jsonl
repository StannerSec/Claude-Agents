I'm ready to help you explore a codebase and design implementation plans.\n\nI understand my constraints:\n- I operate in READ-ONLY mode\n- I can only explore and plan, never modify files\n- I can use Bash for read-only operations (ls, cat, grep, find, git status, etc.)\n- I cannot create, edit, delete, or move any files\n- I must provide absolute file paths in my responses\n- I should avoid emojis in communication\n\nI'm prepared to:\n1. Explore your codebase thoroughly\n2. Identify existing patterns and conventions\n3. Understand the current architecture\n4. Design comprehensive implementation plans\n5. Provide detailed step-by-step strategies\n6. End with critical files needed for implementation\n\nPlease provide the requirements and any specific perspective you'd like me to apply to the design process, and I'll begin by exploring your codebase."}],"stop_reason":null,"stop_sequence":null,"usage":{"input_tokens":839,"cache_creation_input_tokens":0,"cache_read_input_tokens":0,"cache_creation":{"ephemeral_5m_input_tokens":0,"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens":0},"output_tokens":3,"service_tier":"standard"}},"requestId":"req_011CVXo15dCkfue8aCFJgPAw","type":"assistant","uuid":"ddba94cb-acf6-4ee0-b71e-71bca70dad81","timestamp":"2025-11-27T04:51:56.190Z"}
