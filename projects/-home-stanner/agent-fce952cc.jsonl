There was a 4x increase in identity attacks compared to the previous year, along with notable increases in infostealers, macOS threats, and business email compromise.\n\n### Shift from Backdoors to Infostealers\n\nDue to effectiveness of EDR solutions in detecting persistent malware deployed via email, threat actors have shifted strategies to focus on identities, manifesting in increased use of infostealers and a shift towards credential phishing. In 2024, there was an 84% increase in infostealers delivered via phishing.\n\n### AI-Driven Attack Tactics\n\nAI is being used to automate phishing campaigns, evade security measures, conduct advanced reconnaissance, create deepfakes, develop self-learning malware, and conduct highly targeted social engineering attacks.

Threat actors continue to exploit both old and newly discovered flaws in NTLM for credential theft, privilege escalation, and lateral movement. Recent vulnerabilities like CVE-2024-43451, CVE-2025-24054, and CVE-2025-33073 have been actively exploited in various campaigns. Attacks involve hash leakage, coercion-based techniques, credential forwarding, and man-in-the-middle approaches. Threat groups like BlindEagle and Head Mare have leveraged these vulnerabilities to distribute malware and target specific regions. To mitigate risks, organizations are advised to disable or limit NTLM usage, implement message signing, enable Extended Protection for Authentication, and monitor NTLM traffic closely.\\n   Tags: exploits, apt, authentication, cve-2025-24071, ntlm, cve-2024-43451, cve-2025-33073, lateral movement, warzone, cve-2023-38831, remcos rat, phantomcore, credential theft, vulnerabilities, windows, cve-2025-24054, avemaria\\n   Targeted Countries: Belarus, Colombia, Russian Federation, Uzbekistan\\n   Industries: Manufacturing, Education, Government, Finance\\n   Adversary: BlindEagle\\n\\n   Indicators (9 total):\\n  • [CVE] CVE-2023-38831\\n  • [CVE] CVE-2024-43451\\n  • [CVE] CVE-2025-24054\\n  • [CVE] CVE-2025-24071\\n  • [CVE] CVE-2025-33073\\n  • [IPv4] 185.227.82.72\\n  • [IPv4] 45.87.246.40\\n  • [URL] http://document-file.ru/files/documents/zakupki/MicrosoftWord.exe\\n  • [domain] document-file.ru\\n\\n   References:\\n   - https://securelist.com/ntlm-abuse-in-2025/118132/\\n------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n📍 **Infrastructure of Interest: Medium Confidence Detection**\\n   ID: 6894583edc4b67d5c7c5cb34\\n   Author: AlienVault\\n   Created: 2025-08-07T07:39:42.586000\\n   Modified: 2025-11-26T13:59:01.214000\\n   TLP: WHITE\\n   Description: These indicators of compromise (IOCs) were identified through LevelBlue Labs' proprietary collection and threat hunting processes, leveraging AI-driven heuristics to detect anomalous patterns, behavioral analysis of malicious activity, and cross-referenced intelligence from endpoint telemetry and external sources.

The campaign mimics legitimate recruitment processes, offering job listings from well-known tech companies to lure victims. The platform, hosted at lenvny[.]com, is designed to appear as a legitimate AI-powered interview tool.

Threat actors continue to exploit both old and newly discovered flaws in NTLM for credential theft, privilege escalation, and lateral movement. Recent vulnerabilities like CVE-2024-43451, CVE-2025-24054, and CVE-2025-33073 have been actively exploited in various campaigns. Attacks involve hash leakage, coercion-based techniques, credential forwarding, and man-in-the-middle approaches. Threat groups like BlindEagle and Head Mare have leveraged these vulnerabilities to distribute malware and target specific regions. To mitigate risks, organizations are advised to disable or limit NTLM usage, implement message signing, enable Extended Protection for Authentication, and monitor NTLM traffic closely.\\n   Tags: exploits, apt, authentication, cve-2025-24071, ntlm, cve-2024-43451, cve-2025-33073, lateral movement, warzone, cve-2023-38831, remcos rat, phantomcore, credential theft, vulnerabilities, windows, cve-2025-24054, avemaria\\n   Targeted Countries: Belarus, Colombia, Russian Federation, Uzbekistan\\n   Industries: Manufacturing, Education, Government, Finance\\n   Adversary: BlindEagle\\n\\n   Indicators (9 total):\\n  • [CVE] CVE-2023-38831\\n  • [CVE] CVE-2024-43451\\n  • [CVE] CVE-2025-24054\\n  • [CVE] CVE-2025-24071\\n  • [CVE] CVE-2025-33073\\n  • [IPv4] 185.227.82.72\\n  • [IPv4] 45.87.246.40\\n  • [URL] http://document-file.ru/files/documents/zakupki/MicrosoftWord.exe\\n  • [domain] document-file.ru\\n\\n   References:\\n   - https://securelist.com/ntlm-abuse-in-2025/118132/\\n------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n📍 **Infrastructure of Interest: Medium Confidence Detection**\\n   ID: 6894583edc4b67d5c7c5cb34\\n   Author: AlienVault\\n   Created: 2025-08-07T07:39:42.586000\\n   Modified: 2025-11-26T13:59:01.214000\\n   TLP: WHITE\\n   Description: These indicators of compromise (IOCs) were identified through LevelBlue Labs' proprietary collection and threat hunting processes, leveraging AI-driven heuristics to detect anomalous patterns, behavioral analysis of malicious activity, and cross-referenced intelligence from endpoint telemetry and external sources.

Cloud-native and identity-enabled techniques surged, with Cloud Accounts, Email Forwarding Rule, and Email Hiding Rules ranking among the top five.\n\nData from Cloud Storage (T1530) and Disable or Modify Cloud Firewall (T1562.007) also cracked the top 10 list for the first time ever.\n\n## Key Trends\n\n**Identity and Cloud Threats:** The report noted four times as many identity attacks compared to the 2024 edition. Red Canary detected roughly 5 times as many identity-related detections in the first half of 2025 compared to all of 2024, reflecting increased adoption of identity security tools and improvements in detection coverage.\n\n**Paste-and-Run Attacks:** Paste-and-run initial access schemes (aka ClickFix, fakeCAPTCHA) spurred MITRE to create Malicious Copy Paste (T1204.004).\n\n**Top Threats:** Red Canary detected a rash of color bird threats in the first half of 2025, led by stealer-like Amber Albatross and dropper Scarlet Goldfinch.
