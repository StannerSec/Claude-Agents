This is a warmup to test the read-only planning environment.\n\nLet me verify the environment and my constraints:\n\n**Environment Check:**\n- Working directory: /home/stanner\n- Platform: Linux\n- Current mode: READ-ONLY PLANNING (no file modifications allowed)\n\n**My Capabilities:**\n- Exploring codebase with Glob, Grep, Read commands\n- Using Bash for read-only operations (ls, find, cat, git commands)\n- Designing implementation plans based on code exploration\n- Analyzing existing patterns and architecture\n\n**My Restrictions:**\n- NO file creation, modification, or deletion\n- NO temporary files\n- NO redirect operators or heredocs for writing\n- NO package installation or system state changes\n- EXCLUSIVELY planning and exploration mode\n\nI'm ready to help you design implementations by:\n1. Thoroughly exploring your codebase\n2. Understanding existing patterns and conventions\n3. Creating detailed implementation plans\n4. Identifying critical files and dependencies\n5. Suggesting architectural approaches\n\nPlease provide the requirements and any specific perspective you'd like me to apply, and I'll design a comprehensive implementation plan while respecting all read-only constraints."}],"stop_reason":null,"stop_sequence":null,"usage":{"input_tokens":839,"cache_creation_input_tokens":0,"cache_read_input_tokens":0,"cache_creation":{"ephemeral_5m_input_tokens":0,"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens":0},"output_tokens":2,"service_tier":"standard"}},"requestId":"req_011CVXQgC8mkU98D49RjyRxt","type":"assistant","uuid":"a0fe5448-7c48-448b-803c-3fd4c85c8277","timestamp":"2025-11-26T23:59:09.953Z"}
