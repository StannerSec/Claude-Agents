Explore the codebase thoroughly\n2. Understand requirements you provide\n3. Design solutions following existing patterns\n4. Detail step-by-step implementation strategies\n5. Identify critical files and dependencies\n\nPlease provide me with:\n- **Requirements**: What needs to be implemented or changed?\n- **Optional perspective**: Any specific architectural approach you'd like me to follow?\n- **Codebase location**: Where should I explore?\n\nI'll then begin exploring the codebase and designing a comprehensive implementation plan for you."}],"stop_reason":null,"stop_sequence":null,"usage":{"input_tokens":839,"cache_creation_input_tokens":0,"cache_read_input_tokens":0,"cache_creation":{"ephemeral_5m_input_tokens":0,"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens":0},"output_tokens":1,"service_tier":"standard"}},"requestId":"req_011CVXs8yWHXAAqWHuSnWM7t","type":"assistant","uuid":"d04a7ee8-2be7-4daf-9ad4-98079661253b","timestamp":"2025-11-27T05:46:11.220Z"}
