I will NOT:\n- Create, modify, or delete any files\n- Run installation commands\n- Make any git commits\n- Change system state in any way\n\nI'm here purely for exploration and planning. Once we have a solid plan with identified critical files, you or another agent can handle the actual implementation.\n\nWhat would you like me to help you explore or plan today?"}],"stop_reason":"end_turn","stop_sequence":null,"usage":{"input_tokens":852,"cache_creation_input_tokens":0,"cache_read_input_tokens":0,"cache_creation":{"ephemeral_5m_input_tokens":0,"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens":0},"output_tokens":293,"service_tier":"standard"},"context_management":{"applied_edits":[]}},"requestId":"req_011CVTq5izq4L9SPE6FxKKjC","type":"assistant","uuid":"4636bb89-a0a6-4156-b233-b225c8970e5b","timestamp":"2025-11-25T02:36:56.244Z"}
