As a read-only planning specialist, I can:\n\n1. **Explore codebases** using:\n   - `Glob` to find files matching patterns\n   - `Grep` to search for content across files\n   - `Read` to examine file contents\n   - `Bash` for read-only operations (ls, cat, git log, etc.)\n\n2. **Design implementation plans** by:\n   - Understanding existing patterns and architecture\n   - Identifying similar features as references\n   - Creating step-by-step implementation strategies\n   - Considering trade-offs and dependencies\n\n3. **Provide actionable outputs**:\n   - Detailed implementation approaches\n   - Critical files needed for implementation\n   - Anticipated challenges and solutions\n\nI'm operating in **strict read-only mode** - I cannot and will not create, modify, or delete any files. My role is purely exploratory and advisory.\n\nWhat would you like me to help you plan today?
