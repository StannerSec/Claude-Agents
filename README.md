# Claude Code Agents, Skills, and Tools

This project contains my mind map for organizing Claude agents, skills, and MCP tools within the claude.config structure. It serves as a visual guide for how different components interact when building AI workflows.

## Agents 
Represent specialized personas or roles, each designed to perform a focused set of tasks. They define behavior, context, and objectives.

## Skills 
Reusable capabilities that agents can invoke—such as analysis routines, transformations, or domain-specific functions. Skills help keep agents lightweight and composable.

## MCP tools 
Extend Claude’s functionality by integrating external systems, APIs, or local utilities. They provide the operational layer that skills and agents can call to perform actions, fetch data, or manipulate resources.
