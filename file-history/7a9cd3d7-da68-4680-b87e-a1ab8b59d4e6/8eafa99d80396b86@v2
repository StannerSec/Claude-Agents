# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

This is a simple Python CLI tool that simulates rolling dice. The project contains a single `test.py` file with a dice roller utility.

## Running the Application

**Run the dice roller:**
```bash
python test.py
```

The application enters an interactive loop where users can:
- Enter `<num_dice> <num_sides>` to roll dice (e.g., `2 6` to roll 2 six-sided dice)
- Enter `q` to quit
- Press Ctrl+C to exit

## Architecture

The application has two main components:

1. **`roll_dice(num_dice=1, num_sides=6)`** - Core logic that generates random dice rolls and returns individual results plus their sum

2. **`main()`** - Interactive CLI interface that:
   - Displays the application title
   - Accepts and validates user input (handles non-numeric input and invalid ranges)
   - Calls `roll_dice()` and displays formatted results
   - Implements graceful exit handling

**Stack:** Pure Python 3.x with only standard library dependencies (`random` module)

## Project Structure

```
test.py              # Single-file CLI application
```

**Note:** The project is in early stages. No build system, test framework, or external dependencies are currently configured.
