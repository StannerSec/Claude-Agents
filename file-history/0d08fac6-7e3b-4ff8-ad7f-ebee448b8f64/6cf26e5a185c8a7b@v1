## MCP Server Integration: Synthetic Log Generator

You have access to the `synthetic-log-generator` MCP server which provides critical tools for rule development and validation:

### Available Tools

#### 1. `generate_logs_from_threat_intel`
Generate synthetic logs directly from threat intelligence data.

**Use when:** You have threat intelligence data from the threat-intel-researcher and need to create realistic test logs.

**Input:**
```json
{
  "threat_intel": {
    "name": "MalwareName",
    "description": "Description",
    "techniques": ["T1234", "T5678"],
    "iocs": {
      "filenames": ["malware.exe"],
      "paths": ["C:\\temp"],
      "registry_keys": ["HKLM\\Software\\..."]
    },
    "log_patterns": [
      {
        "rule_id": "100200",
        "type": "process_creation",
        "technique": "T1234",
        "fields": {
          "program": "sysmon",
          "win.eventdata.commandLine": "malware.exe -install"
        }
      }
    ]
  },
  "count": 5
}
```

**Output:** Array of synthetic logs that match the threat's behavior patterns.

#### 2. `generate_logs_from_rule`
Generate synthetic logs that would match a specific Wazuh rule.

**Use when:** You've created a rule and want to generate test data to validate it works correctly.

**Input:**
```json
{
  "rule_xml": "<rule id=\"100100\" level=\"10\"><match>Failed password</match><description>SSH brute force</description></rule>",
  "count": 5
}
```

**Output:** Array of synthetic logs with matching content for the rule.

#### 3. `validate_logs_against_rule`
Test whether generated logs would trigger a Wazuh rule.

**Use when:** You need to verify that your rules correctly detect the threat behaviors.

**Input:**
```json
{
  "logs": [
    {
      "expected_rule_id": "100100",
      "fields": {
        "program": "sshd",
        "message": "Failed password for invalid user admin"
      }
    }
  ],
  "rule_xml": "<rule id=\"100100\" level=\"10\"><match>Failed password</match></rule>"
}
```

**Output:** Validation results with match rate and detailed per-log results.

#### 4. `generate_custom_logs`
Generate synthetic logs with custom field values.

**Use when:** You want to create specific test scenarios with exact field values.

**Input:**
```json
{
  "fields": {
    "program": "sshd",
    "srcip": "203.0.113.100",
    "message": "Failed password for invalid user admin"
  },
  "rule_id": "100100",
  "count": 3
}
```

**Output:** Array of custom logs ready for testing.



Make sure the output is simple and clean for me to read. For the sysnthetic log generator, just show pass or fail, not thousands of line outputs.
